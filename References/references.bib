abstract = {{Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are an exciting new primate model for understanding human aging and disease. In captivity, Microcebus murinus develops human-like ailments of old age after five years (e.g., neurodegeneration analogous to Alzheimer's disease) but can live beyond 12 years. It is believed that wild Microcebus follow a similar pattern of senescence observed in captive animals, but that predation limits their lifespan to four years, thus preventing observance of these diseases in the wild. Testing whether this assumption is true is informative about both Microcebus natural history and environmental influences on senescence, leading to interpretation of findings for models of human aging. Additionally, the study of Microcebus longevity provides an opportunity to better understand mechanisms of sex-biased longevity. Longevity is often shorter in males of species with high male-male competition, such as Microcebus, but mouse lemurs are sexually monomorphic, suggesting similar lifespans. We collected individual-based observations of wild brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) from 2003–2010 to investigate sex-differences in survival and longevity. Fecal testosterone was measured as a potential mechanism of sex-based differences in survival. We used a combination of high-resolution tooth wear techniques, mark-recapture, and hormone enzyme immunoassays. We found no dental or physical signs of senescence in M. rufus as old as eight years (N = 189, ages 1–8, mean = 2.59±1.63 SE), three years older than captive, senescent congeners (M. murinus). Unlike other polygynandrous vertebrates, we found no sex difference in age-dependent survival, nor sex or age differences in testosterone levels. While elevated male testosterone levels have been implicated in shorter lifespans in several species, this is one of the first studies to show equivalent testosterone levels accompanying equivalent lifespans. Future research on captive aged individuals can determine if senescence is partially a condition of their captive environment, and studies controlling for various environmental factors will further our understanding of senescence.}},

abstract = {{Vertebrates show left–right biases in turning direction, limb usage, predator-escape response and use of sensory organs. In particular, some fishes are known to have lateral biases in predatory behaviors corresponding to their morphological antisymmetry. To reveal the effects of these laterally biased behaviors on predator–prey interaction, we conducted behavioral tests of predatory events between largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, and freshwater gobies, Rhinogobius sp., both of which have individuals with a well-developed left side and individuals with a well-developed right side. The left-developed bass tended to approach the goby clockwise from behind, whereas right-developed individuals tended to approach counterclockwise. Congruently, left-developed gobies began their escape maneuvers at a longer distance from bass when they were approached clockwise than when they were approached counterclockwise, whereas right-developed gobies showed the reverse tendency. The longer the distance between bass and gobies at the start of goby escape, the more the subsequent bass strike or dash was delayed. Under these conditions, predation should be more successful when a left (right)-developed bass meets a right (left)-developed goby, and less successful when a left (right)-developed bass meets a left (right)-developed goby. This prediction was consistent with the difference in predation success in our test and in field data from Lake Biwa, Japan. We conclude that lateral biases in the behavioral direction of each morphological type will generate bias in predation success between different combinations of predator and prey types, leading to the maintenance of antisymmetric dimorphism through negative frequency-dependent natural selection.}},

Considering their limited morphological distinction the comparison revealed unexpectedly great molecular difference between the two orangutans.

As an initial step to establish a monkey model for the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying somatopause and menopause, we have conducted three experiments in unrestrained aged (∼25.7-yr-old) and young (∼5.4-yr-old) female rhesus monkeys. GH release was pulsatile, and mean GH release and pulse amplitude were significantly lower in aged monkeys than in young monkeys. Injection of GHRH alone, GH-releasing peptide-2 alone, or the combination of both induced an increase in GH release in both age groups. The mean LH level, pulse amplitude, and baseline LH levels were significantly higher in aged animals than in young animals. Both estrogen and IGF-I levels were lower in aged than young monkeys. These results suggest that in female rhesus monkeys 1) there is a clear decline in circulating GH and IGF-I levels with aging; 2) GHRH and GH-releasing peptide-2 stimulate GH release synergistically; and 3) circulating LH levels increase as estrogen decreases with aging. These results indicate that the rhesus monkey is an excellent model for studies of the neuroendocrine mechanisms of aging.}},

The research involves the dissection of 11 orangutans of both sexes in a variety of age categories. All specimens possess either a fat pad or a subcutaneous connective tissue fascial compartment in the lateral face extending superiorly from slightly above the inferior border of the mandible to the temporal region. In immature specimens as well as adult females, fat deposits within the connective tissue compartment are scarce or nonexistent, whereas pubescent male specimens or older possess accumulations of fibro‐fatty tissues in this region. The extensive fat accumulations of the adult male cheek flange are related to age and sex and to modifications in related facial musculature, especially mm. platysma, zygomaticus, orbicularis oculi, and orbitotemporalis and frontalis. These muscles are clearly related to the cheek pad structures in both sexes but appear to assume a supportive role in the males. The cheek pad has no direct bony attachments, but its mass may have a significant effect on facial morphology. The development of the cheek pad is temporally variable and its function remains speculative although the presence of a fully developed flange may be related to behavioral modifications.}},

Such data are particularly applicable in evaluating the life histories and phylogenetic relationships of recently discovered immature fossil apes. Recent studies have described (Winkler, 1987 et seq.) various aspects of orangutan anatomy and dental and somatic development documenting similarities between the orangutan and the other great apes as well as several differences in anatomical structure and developmental pattern. Many great ape similarities may be shared generalized anthropoid traits, whereas the differences can be explained, in many cases, by morphologies or developmental patterns unique to the orangutan. Because of extreme variability in many aspects of orangutan development and morphology, a great deal more information is needed to clarify taxonomic issues.}},

abstract = {{Almost fifty years ago the advent of assay methods to measure circulating levels of hormones revolutionized endocrinology in relation to investigations of free-living and captive animals. This new field “environmental endocrinology” revealed that endocrine profiles in animals in their natural habitat were not only different from captive animals, but often deviated from predictions. It quickly became apparent that the organization and analysis of data from the field should be sorted by life history stages such as for reproductive processes, migration, molt etc. and spaced in time according to natural duration of those processes. Presentation of data by calendar date alone gives much simpler, even misleading, patterns. Stage-organized analyses revealed species-specific patterns of hormone secretion and dramatic inter-individual differences. The “Challenge Hypothesis” sparked exploration of these results, which diverged from expectations of hormone-behavior interactions. The hypothesis led to specific predictions about how the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonad axis, and particularly circulating patterns of testosterone, might respond to social challenges such as simulated territorial intrusions. Initially, a group of studies on free-living and captive birds played a key role in the formulation of the hypothesis. Over the decades since, the effects of social challenge and environmental context on hormonal responses have been tested in all vertebrate taxa, including humans, as well as in insects. Although it is now clear that the Challenge Hypothesis in its original form is simplistic, field and laboratory tests of the hypothesis have led to other concepts that have become seminal to the development of environmental endocrinology as a field. In this special issue these developments are addressed and examples from many different taxa enrich the emerging concepts, paving the way for investigations using recent technologies for genetic and transcriptome analyses.}},

The evidence suggests that such a taste is primarily a masculine attribute, and is socially facilitated by the presence of peers in pursuit of the same goals.Such dangerous, competitive acts as the classic “trivial altercation” homicide often appear foolhardy to observers.

The species is critically endangered because of forest loss and poaching, and therefore, determining the impact of future land-use change on this species is important. To date, the total Sumatran orangutan population has been estimated at 6600 individuals. On the basis of new transect surveys, we estimate a population of 14,613 in 2015. This higher estimate is due to three factors. First, orangutans were found at higher elevations, elevations previously considered outside of their range and, consequently, not surveyed previously. Second, orangutans were found more widely distributed in logged forests. Third, orangutans were found in areas west of the Toba Lake that were not previously surveyed. This increase in numbers is therefore due to a more wide-ranging survey effort and is not indicative of an increase in the orangutan population in Sumatra. There are evidently more Sumatran orangutans remaining in the wild than we thought, but the species remains under serious threat. Current scenarios for future forest loss predict that as many as 4500 individuals could vanish by 2030. Despite the positive finding that the population is double the size previously estimated, our results indicate that future deforestation will continue to be the cause of rapid declines in orangutan numbers. Hence, we urge that all developmental planning involving forest loss be accompanied by appropriate environmental impact assessments conforming with the current national and provincial legislations, and, through these, implement specific measures to reduce or, better, avoid negative impacts on forests where orangutans occur.}},

These results indicate that in 2004 there were c. 6,500 P. abelii remaining on Sumatra and at least 54,000 P. pygmaeus on Borneo. Extrapolating to 2008 on the basis of forest loss on both islands suggests the estimate for Borneo could be 10\% too high but that for Sumatra is probably still relatively accurate because forest loss in orang-utan habitat has been low during the conflict in Aceh, where most P. abelii occur. When those population sizes are compared to known historical sizes it is clear that the Sumatran orang-utan is in rapid decline, and unless extraordinary efforts are made soon, it could become the first great ape species to go extinct. In contrast, our results indicate there are more and larger populations of Bornean orang-utans than previously known. Although these revised estimates for Borneo are encouraging, forest loss and associated loss of orang-utans are occurring at an alarming rate, and suggest that recent reductions of Bornean orang-utan populations have been far more severe than previously supposed. Nevertheless, although orang-utans on both islands are under threat, we highlight some reasons for cautious optimism for their long-term conservation.}},

Although this claim has been widely repeated, several studies have reported no such association. Therefore, we test the generality of this association, using meta‐analysis, by converting test statistics for the relationship between heterozygosity (H) and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) into a common effect size, the Pearson’s product‐moment correlation coefficient. We have analysed a database containing 41 studies with a total of 118 individual samples. Overall we found an unweighted mean negative effect size; r=−0.09 (i.e. a negative correlation between H and FA). Significant heterogeneity in effect size was mainly caused by a difference between ectothermic and endothermic animals, and to a lesser extent by the use of different study designs (i.e. within‐population vs. among‐populations). Mean effect size for endothermic animals was positive and significantly different from the mean effect size for ectothermic animals. Only for within‐population studies of ectothermic animals did we find a significantly negative effect size (r=−0.23 ± 0.09). The distribution of effect sizes in relation to sample size provided little evidence for patterns typical of those produced by publication bias. Our analysis suggests, at best, only a weak association between H and FA, and heterozygosity seems to explain only a very small amount of the variation in developmental instability among individuals and populations (r2=0.01 for the total material).}},

abstract = {{Unsustainable exploitation of natural resources is increasingly affecting the highly biodiverse tropics [1, 2]. Although rapid developments in remote sensing technology have permitted more precise estimates of land-cover change over large spatial scales [3–5], our knowledge about the effects of these changes on wildlife is much more sparse [6, 7]. Here we use field survey data, predictive density distribution modeling, and remote sensing to investigate the impact of resource use and land-use changes on the density distribution of Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus). Our models indicate that between 1999 and 2015, half of the orangutan population was affected by logging, deforestation, or industrialized plantations. Although land clearance caused the most dramatic rates of decline, it accounted for only a small proportion of the total loss. A much larger number of orangutans were lost in selectively logged and primary forests, where rates of decline were less precipitous, but where far more orangutans are found. This suggests that further drivers, independent of land-use change, contribute to orangutan loss. This finding is consistent with studies reporting hunting as a major cause in orangutan decline [8–10]. Our predictions of orangutan abundance loss across Borneo suggest that the population decreased by more than 100,000 individuals, corroborating recent estimates of decline [11]. Practical solutions to prevent future orangutan decline can only be realized by addressing its complex causes in a holistic manner across political and societal sectors, such as in land-use planning, resource exploitation, infrastructure development, and education, and by increasing long-term sustainability [12].

Combining projections of future deforestation with species density information provides an improved way to anticipate such declines. Using the critically endangered Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) as a case study we applied a spatio-temporally explicit deforestation model to forest loss data from 2001 to 2017 and projected future impacts on orangutans to the 2030s. Our projections point to continued deforestation across the island, amounting to a potential loss of forest habitat for 26,200 orangutans. Populations currently persisting in forests gazetted for industrial timber and oil palm concessions, or unprotected forests outside of concessions, were projected to experience the worst losses within the next 15 years, amounting to 15,400 individuals. Our analysis indicates the importance of protecting orangutan habitat in plantation landscapes, maintaining protected areas and efforts to prevent the conversion of logged forests for the survival of highly vulnerable wildlife. The modeling framework could be expanded to other species with available density or occurrence data. Our findings highlight that species conservation should not only act on the current information, but also anticipate future changes to be effective.}},

This variation is exemplified by the peatland forests of Central Kalimantan, which are characterized by unpredictable fruiting fluctuations, relatively low levels of fruit availability, and low fruit periods (<3\% of trees fruiting) that can last nearly a year. Challenged by these environments, large, arboreal frugivores like orangutans must periodically rely on non‐preferred, lower‐quality foods to meet their nutritional needs. We examined variation in nutrient intake among age‐sex classes and seasons over a 7‐year period at the Tuanan Orangutan Research Station in Central Kalimantan. We conducted 2,316 full‐day focal follows on 62 habituated orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii). We found differences in total energy and macronutrient intake across age‐sex classes, controlling for metabolic body mass. Intake of both total energy and macronutrients varied with fruit availability, and preference of dietary items increased with their nutritional quality. Foraging‐related variables, such as day journey length, travel time, and feeding time, also varied among age‐sex classes and with fruit availability. Our results add to the growing body of literature suggesting that great variation in foraging strategies exists among species, populations, and age‐sex classes and in response to periods of resource scarcity.

abstract = {{The postulates of developmental instability–sexual selection hypothesis is intensely debated among evolutionary biologists, wherein despite a large amount of empirical data, evidence for or against it has been largely inconclusive. A key assumption of this hypothesis is that animals assess symmetry in potential mates as an indicator of genetic quality (developmental stability), and consequently use this information to discriminate against those with higher asymmetries while choosing mates. However, the perceptional basis that must underlie such discriminatory behavior (is symmetry a signal or is symmetry signaled) is not clearly defined. It is also argued that since asymmetry levels in natural populations are very low, the low signal‐to‐noise ratio would make accurate assessment of symmetry both difficult and costly. Rather than attempting to validate this hypothesis or even as to whether animals assess mate symmetry, this review simply aims to examine the plausibility that animals perceive symmetry (directly or indirectly) and consequently discriminate against asymmetric mates in response to perceived irregularities during courtship. For this, we review mate choice and courtship literature to identify potential sensory cues that might advertise asymmetry or lead to discrimination of asymmetric individuals. Although signaling associated with mate choice is commonly multimodal, previous studies on asymmetry have mainly focused on visual perception. In the light of a recent study (Vijendravarma et al., 2022, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 119, e2116136119), this review attempts to balance this bias by emphasizing on non‐visual perception of asymmetry. In conclusion, we discuss the methodological challenges associated with testing the role of multimodal cues in detecting mate asymmetry, and highlight the importance of considering ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary aspects of animals while interpreting empirical data that test such hypothesis. We review how multimodal non‐visual cues can signal morphological asymmetry of potential mates during courtship in diverse species across taxa. We also discuss how extended phenotypes and mate choice copying aid females to indirectly assess and discriminate against asymmetric males. With the current emphasis on multimodal communication during courtship, this review is well timed to rekindle interest in the role of symmetry during mate choice.}},

However, whereas some adult male orang-utans develop full secondary sexual characteristics, such as cheek flanges, others may stay in an “ arrested” unflanged condition for up to 20 years after reaching sexual maturity. The result is a marked bimaturism among adult males. Flanged males allow females to overlap with their home range and often tolerate the presence of unflanged males. However, wherever possible flanged males actively prevent unflanged males from copulating with females. Two competing hypotheses, previously untested, have been advanced to explain male reproductive behavior and bimaturism in orang-utans: (1) the “ range-guardian” hypothesis, which asserts that the flanged males are postreproductive and defend a range in which they tolerate sexually active, unflanged male relatives; and (2) the “female choice” hypothesis, which asserts that flanged males tolerate unflanged males in their range because they rely on female preference to favor flanged males. We investigated these hypotheses and a third hypothesis that the two male morphs represent co-existing alternative male reproductive strategies (“sitting, calling, and waiting” for flanged males versus “ going, searching, and finding” for unflanged males). Fecal samples were collected from a well-studied population in Indonesia, and eight human microsatellites were analyzed for 30 individuals that have been behaviorally monitored for up to 27 years. By carrying out paternity analysis on 11 offspring born over 15 years, we found that unflanged males fathered about half (6) of the offspring. Relatedness between successful unflanged males and resident dominant males was significantly lower than 0.5, and for some unflanged/flanged male pairs, relatedness values were negative, indicating that unflanged males are not offspring of the flanged males.}},

As predicted from the hypothesis that the degree of facial masculinity is an honest signal of individual quality, men's facial masculinity correlated negatively and women's positively with respiratory disease number and duration. Stomach illness, however, was not associated significantly with facial masculinity and antibiotic use correlated significantly (negatively) only with men's facial masculinity. For both facial asymmetry and body FA, significant, positive associations were seen with the number of respiratory infections. In addition, facial asymmetry was associated positively with the number of days infected and marginally, in the same direction, with antibiotic use. Facial attractiveness showed no significant relationships with any of our health-history measures.

While androgen variation had previously been viewed as a state-dependent characteristic of male developmental status, our study reveals that differences in the physiology of early and late developing males are detectable long past the developmental transition and may instead be trait-level characteristics associated with a male’s life history strategy. Further studies are needed to determine how early in life differences in testosterone levels emerge and what consequences this variation may have for male behavioral strategies.}},

abstract = {{Evidence for age-related effects on wound healing have been derived for the most part from empirical observations without adjustment for confounders other than age. Age-related changes in the structure and function of the skin do occur. Some of these changes result from chronic solar radiation exposure rather than chronological age per se. The tensile strength of wounds, accumulation of wound healing factors and rate of wound closure have all been examined in relation to chronological aging. However, the clinical impact of these changes in acute wound healing appears to be small. Poor healing in chronic wounds is more often related to comorbid conditions rather than age alone. Since the majority of these chronic wounds occur in elderly populations, this has contributed to the conclusion that aging itself may influence healing. Progress in understanding the role that growth factors play in wound healing and the ability to synthesise adequate quantities of these factors for clinical use has led to clinical trials evaluating their use in wound healing. The results of these studies, with the possible exception of those in diabetic wounds, have been disappointing. Insight into the wound healing process indicates that growth factors interact during wound healing in a sequential and orderly process. Improved wound healing may require different clinical designs or the use of these factors in a precisely timed sequential administration.}},

Compliance of the chest wall diminishes, thereby increasing work of breathing when compared with younger subjects. Respiratory muscle strength also decreases with ageing, and is strongly correlated with nutritional status and cardiac index. Expiratory flow rates decrease with a characteristic alteration in the flow–volume curve suggesting small airway disease. The ventilation–perfusion ratio (V ′A/Q ′) heterogeneity increases, with low V ′A/Q ′ zones appearing as a result of premature closing of dependent airways. Carbon monoxide transfer decreases with age, reflecting mainly a loss of surface area. In spite of these changes, the respiratory system remains capable of maintaining adequate gas exchange at rest and during exertion during the entire lifespan, with only a slight decrease in arterial oxygen tension, and no significant change in arterial carbon dioxide tension. Ageing tends to diminish the reserve of the respiratory system in cases of acute disease. Decreased sensitivity of respiratory centres to hypoxia or hypercapnia results in a diminished ventilatory response in cases of heart failure, infection or aggravated airway obstruction. Furthermore, decreased perception bronchoconstriction and diminished physical activity may result in lesser awareness of the disease and delayed diagnosis.}},

One entrenched notion is male facial features that are affected by testosterone are used as direct cues in mate preference. Testosterone may be particularly revealing as it is purported to be an honest indicator of male fitness. Increased testosterone may impose an immunocompetence handicap on the bearer and only the best males can carry this handicap. To date, tests of this theory have been indirect, and have relied on digital manipulations that represent unrealistic continuums of masculine and feminine faces. We provide a much more direct test by manipulating digitally male faces to mimic known shape variation, caused by varying levels of testosterone through puberty. We produced a continuum of faces that ranged from low to high levels of testosterone in male faces and asked women to choose the points on the continuum that appeared most attractive and most physically dominant. Our data indicate that high testosterone faces reveal dominance. However, there is no evidence of directional selection for increased (or decreased) testosterone in terms of attractiveness to the opposite sex. We discuss the relevance and applicability of evolutionary interpretations of our data and, contrary to predictions, provide evidence of stabilizing selection acting on testosterone through mate preferences.}},

Daily behavioral research on Sumatran Orangutan (Pongo abelii) mothers and offsprings at Suaq Balimbing Research Station, Gunung Leuser National Park, Aceh Province, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 5108-5121. Discovering the daily behavior of female orangutan mothers and their offspring can provide information for use as a recent reference in orangutan conservation action plans. This research aims to determine the daily behavioral patterns of mother and offspring Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) at the Suaq Balimbing research station. This study was conducted between June 2019 and March 2020 and used focal animal sampling as the method. The method used consists of searching and daily behavioral logging. The results of the research showed that six orangutan mothers and offsprings (three mother-offspring pairs) showed different behavioral patterns. The distinction was felt in the distribution of time spent on activities. Eating, moving, resting, nesting, and social activity are all part of an orangutan's daily behavior. The proportion of time allocation used in the daily activities of female mother and Sumatran orangutan pairs (Pongo abelii) that is successfully observed in the Suaq Balimbing research station are eating (68.79\%), resting (11.59\%), moving (11.02\%), nesting (1.11\%), others (5.04\%) and unknown (2.45\%). Orangutans' diet plants in Suaq Balimbing consist of 30 species from 25 families, including the liana diet, plants consumed with the seeds, and plants consumed by the bark. According to the findings of this study, the behavior of a mother Sumatran orangutan, while it is with its offspring can be described.}},

Longitudinal and cross‐sectional data on weight and age in three troops that lived under a variety of ecological circumstances showed a good fit to the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Male and female baboons have different growth constants (K) and different asymptotic weights and ages resulting in the observed baboon sexual dimorphism. Within sexes, growth constants and asymptotic weights varied between troops in the same year and for the same troop in different years. Improvements in nutrition increased growth rate and final weight and decreased age at asymptote in both naturally foraging and in food‐enhanced wild groups. Testes and cape length follow the same growth pattern and have the same asymptotic age as body mass among naturally foraging males. Canine growth is different with full size achieved nearly 2 years earlier. Toothwear is an accurate relative age indicator for immature and adult females and for immature males but not for adult males because of the role that large canines play in occlusion and wear. The data suggest that creating a dichotomy between captive and wild primates is overly simplistic since conditions for growth in the wild can overlap those of captivity, not just for food enhanced individuals but also among naturally foraging troops. The nutritional perspective on primate growth exposes inherent problems in our present system of primate age classification which have serious implications for the use of age classes in behavioral analyses.}},

However, there has been far less scientific effort to demonstrate the effectiveness of automatic individual identification, which could greatly facilitate research, especially when data are collected via an acoustic localization system (ALS). In this study, we examine the accuracy of acoustic caller recognition in long calls (LCs) emitted by Bornean male orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) derived from two data-sets: the first consists of high-quality recordings taken during individual focal follows (N = 224 LCs by 14 males) and the second consists of LC recordings with variable microphone-caller distances stemming from ALS (N = 123 LCs by 10 males). The LC is a long-distance vocalization. We therefore expect that even the low-quality test-set should yield caller recognition results significantly better than by chance. Automatic individual identification was accomplished using software originally developed for human speaker recognition (i.e. the MSR identity toolbox). We obtained a 93.3\% correct identification rate with high-quality recordings, and 72.23\% with recordings stemming from the ALS with variable microphone-caller distances (20–420 m). These results show that automatic individual identification is possible even though the accuracy declines compared with the results of high-quality recordings due to severe signal degradations (e.g. sound attenuation, environmental noise contamination, and echo interference) with increasing distance. We therefore suggest that acoustic individual identification with speaker recognition software can be a valuable tool to apply to data obtained through an ALS, thereby facilitating field research on vocal communication.}},

In primates, orangutans are the only diurnal semi solitary species showing this roving male promiscuity mating system. Here, we develop and test hypotheses about the nature of male-male competition in Bornean orangutans by examining its sexually selected long-distance calls to disentangle the mechanisms through which males compete over mating access. This study uses a novel approach to disentangle the mechanisms of male-male competition. We established an acoustic localization system (ALS) comprising 20 recorders installed in a grid that allowed accurate localization in an area of 450 ha. With this procedure, we triangulated 1615 long calls over 109 days spread over 10 months to examine the males’ ranging and calling decisions. A male’s choice of area was determined mainly by local fruit availability. Once there, however, his calling behavior depended primarily on the number of sexually attractive females and the number of other flanged males present. Both these variables also predicted the proportion of calls to which individual males responded, and the proportion of males present that responded to long calls of other males. We conclude that intra-sexual competition among Bornean flanged males comprises a combination of contest and scramble competition best summarized as confrontational assessment. Where males range widely in search of scattered fertile females and these females do not broadcast their reproductive state, males could pursue a variety of strategies. Flanged male Bornean orangutans emit long calls serving to attract females and repel male rivals. In order to disentangle whether the competitive tactics of flanged males correspond to scramble or contest competition in their long-distance communication system, we used an acoustic localization approach with a grid of recorders installed in the research are. We found that flanged males go to areas with much food and then engage in vocal, and subsequently, physical battles with rivals, probably because their relative strength fluctuates rapidly. We call this unusual form of contest competition confrontational assessment.}},

Only flanged males emit them, in various contexts: spontaneously (where no disturbances from the environment are perceived by human observers), when highly aroused by another male’s long call or a falling tree nearby, or right after having pushed over a dead tree themselves. In this study, acoustic analyses of orang-utan long calls at Tuanan in Central Kalimantan not only confirm the discrimination of individual males by their long calls but also demonstrate the discrimination of context based on the long calls’ acoustic structure, which is further supported by the females’ ranging responses according to long call contexts. Females with dependent offspring move away from spontaneous long call sources but appear to ignore long calls elicited by disturbance. Hence, Bornean orang-utan females perceive measurable differences in acoustic characteristics of long calls given in different contexts.

We synthesize fossil, archeological, genetic, and behavioral evidence to demonstrate that at least 70,000 years of human influence have shaped orangutan distribution, abundance, and ecology and will likely continue to do so in the future. Our findings indicate that orangutans are vulnerable to hunting but appear flexible in response to some other human activities. This highlights the need for a multifaceted, landscape-level approach to orangutan conservation that leverages sound policy and cooperation among government, private sector, and community stakeholders to prevent hunting, mitigate human-orangutan conflict, and preserve and reconnect remaining natural forests. Broad cooperation can be encouraged through incentives and strategies that focus on the common interests and concerns of different stakeholders.

Interbirth intervals were significantly shorter for females whose infants died before their next conception than for females whose infants survived. High‐ranking mothers of surviving infants had significantly shorter birth intervals than comparable low‐ranking mothers, independent of maternal age. This occurred mainly because the interval from resumption of cycling to conception was significantly shorter for high‐vs. low‐ranking females. Dominance rank did not influence sex ratio at birth, infant survival in the first 2 years, or adult female mortality. Age was also significantly related to interbirth intervals, with older females having shorter intervals. Primiparous females had consistently longer reproductive intervals than did multiparous females, but this difference reached statistical significance only for females whose infants died before the next conception. Primiparous females also experienced significantly higher infant mortality. Data on body size and estrous cycle length indicated no differences between high‐ and low‐ranking females.

Uncovering the cause of these declines can inform how changes in social relationships with age affect health and fitness in later life. While age-based declines in social networks have been thought to be detrimental, physical and physiological limitations associated with age may lead older individuals to adjust their social behavior and be more selective in partner choice. Greater selectivity with age has been shown in humans, but the extent to which this phenomenon occurs across the animal kingdom remains an open question. Using longitudinal data from a population of rhesus macaques on Cayo Santiago, we provide compelling evidence in a nonhuman animal for within-individual increases in social selectivity with age. Our analyses revealed that adult female macaques actively reduced the size of their networks as they aged and focused on partners previously linked to fitness benefits, including kin and partners to whom they were strongly and consistently connected earlier in life. Females spent similar amounts of time socializing as they aged, suggesting that network shrinkage does not result from lack of motivation or ability to engage, nor was this narrowing driven by the deaths of social partners. Furthermore, females remained attractive companions and were not isolated by withdrawal of social partners. Taken together, our results provide rare empirical evidence for social selectivity in nonhumans, suggesting that patterns of increasing selectivity with age may be deeply rooted in primate evolution.}},

Incorporation of these ‘missing variables’ provides evidence that interactions between pre- and post-mating sexual selection can underlie broad patterns of diversification in male weapons and ornaments. We call for more experimental and genetic approaches to uncover trade-offs, as well as for studies that consider the costs of mate-searching.}},

Although several examples of this phenomenon are well known from studies on birds, the idea has often been dismissed as lacking general applicability. This dismissal does not stem from contradictory data so much as from the difficulties inherent in testing the hypothesis, and its apparent lack of parsimony, in comparison to the alternative explanation of sexual selection. The only unequivocal evidence for the evolution of sexual dimorphism through intersexual niche partitioning would be disproportionate dimorphism in trophic structures (e.g., mouthparts). This criterion offers a minimum estimate of the importance of ecological causes for dimorphism, because it may fail to identify most cases. A review of published literature reveals examples of sexually dimorphic trophic structures in most animal phyla. Many of these examples seem to be attributable to sexual selection, but others reflect adaptations for niche divergence between the sexes. For example, dwarf non-feeding males without functional mouthparts have evolved independently in many taxa. In other cases, males and females differ in trophic structures apparently because of differences in diets. Such divergence may often reflect specific nutritional requirements for reproduction in females, or extreme (sexually selected?) differences between males and females in habitats or body sizes. Ecological competition between the sexes may be responsible for intersexual niche divergence in some cases, but the independent evolution of foraging specializations by each sex may be of more general importance. If ecological causation for dimorphism can be demonstrated in so many cases, despite the inadequacies of the available criteria, the degree of sexual size dimorphism in many other animal species may well also have been influenced by ecological factors. Hence, it may be premature to dismiss this hypothesis, despite the difficulty of testing it.}},

Flanged males in consortship with a receptive female frequently chase unflanged males trailing them, but never catch them, so that unflanged males often remain associated with the consort pair. Unflanged males are more tolerant among each other, although attacks also occur. The response of flanged males to long calls they hear depends on their dominance position: the dominant male approaches them, whereas the other males tend to avoid them. There is no conclusive information on the reaction of unflanged males. Data from Sumatra suggest that dominant flanged males and the males challenging them for local dominance were most commonly present in a given study area, suggesting that non-dominant males roamed more widely in search of uncontested access to females.}},

Glucocorticoid levels did not vary systematically with dominance rank, but increased when the dominance hierarchy was unstable, and increased in the presence of receptive females. The relationship between dominance rank and glucocorticoid levels changed direction according to the stability of the dominance hierarchy: glucocorticoid levels were higher in subordinate males under stable conditions, but under conditions of instability higher ranking males had higher glucocorticoid levels. The influence of dominance rank also interacted with the presence of receptive females: glucocorticoids were higher in dominant males than in subordinates, but only during mating periods, suggesting that dominant males are more stressed than subordinates during such periods. These findings support previous studies showing that the relationship between glucocorticoids and dominance rank in male baboons is dependent on the social environment. We also found that males with higher glucocorticoids suffered a higher diversity of gastrointestinal parasite infection, in line with evidence that glucocorticoids suppress the immune system in other species. However, we found no support for the stress-mediated immunocompetence handicap hypothesis for the evolution of condition-dependent ornaments: glucocorticoid and testosterone levels were positively related, rather than the negative relationship predicted by the hypothesis, and we found no relationship between red colour and glucocorticoid levels, suggesting that glucocorticoids do not play a role in translating social conditions or physical health into ornament expression in this species.}},

I use studies of mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), a classic example of extravagant armaments and ornaments in animals, to exemplify how a long‐term, multidisciplinary approach that integrates field observations with laboratory methods can contribute to on‐going theoretical debates in the field of sexual selection. I begin with a brief summary of the main concepts of sexual selection theory and the differences between the sexes. I then introduce mandrills and the study population and review mandrill life history, the ontogeny of sex differences, and maternal effects. Next, I focus on male‐male competition and female choice, followed by the less well‐studied questions of female‐female competition and male choice. This review shows how different reproductive priorities lead to very different life histories and divergent adaptations in males and females. It demonstrates how broadening traditional perspectives on sexual selection beyond the ostentatious results of intense sexual selection on males leads to an understanding of more subtle and cryptic forms of competition and choice in both sexes and opens many productive avenues in the study of primate reproductive strategies. These include the potential for studies of postcopulatory selection, female intrasexual competition, and male choice. These studies of mandrills provide comparison and, I hope, inspiration for studies of both other polygynandrous species and species with mating systems less traditionally associated with sexual selection.

Traditional classifications of mating systems suffer from the problem of not considering reproductive strategies of both males and females equally and are biased by a strong male perspective. Modern sexual selection theory encompasses the conflicting interests of males and females and the evolutionary consequences of all aspects of competition for mates. The chapter focuses on causes, mechanisms, and consequences of sexual selection. In addition, the chapter accounts for the relevance of primates to sexual selection and relevance of sexual selection to primates; and summarizes a great variety of mating systems that exist in primates. The reproductive success of a male primate is limited by the number of females he can fertilize. The main scenarios from the males' perspective and females' perspective of sexual strategies are outlined. Male primates compete for access to females and their gametes; however, they also show mate choice and parental care for infants and this improves their reproductive success. However, female choice for male quality may be less important than female counter-strategies against male coercion, infanticide in particular. Female primate behavior tends to increase the number of males mated with. Female reproductive strategies can act in tandem with male strategies. However, female strategies may also be in opposition to male-male competition. By using a comparative and theory-oriented approach to examine and integrate recent developments in primate sexual selection studies, the chapter draws some general conclusions about sexual selection in primates, identifies reasons why primates were neglected in particular areas of sexual selection research, and stimulates future research on all aspects of sexual selection in primates.}},

Gaining alpha rank (N = 4 males) resulted in increased testicular size and circulating testosterone, reddening of the sexual skin on the face and genitalia, and heightened secretion from the sternal cutaneous gland. Blue sexual skin coloration was unaffected. New alpha males increased in rump “fattedness,” but not in body mass, and spent more time associated with other group members, rather than ranging alone. Loss of alpha position (N = 4 males) resulted in less pronounced effects than those that occurred after males had risen to alpha positions. Deposed alpha males showed decreased testicular volume, decreased body mass, a reduction in the extent of red (but not blue) sexual skin coloration, and decreased sternal gland activity. Deposed males did not decrease in the brightness of sex skin coloration. These results demonstrate that male–male competition and rank reversals have remarkable effects upon testicular function, secondary sexual traits, and behavior in the adult male mandrill.

Researchers have developed tools to measure stress in animals, but these tools have many limitations. A novel measurement of chronic stress using several biomarkers has been studied in humans and great apes, but no research has assessed this tool in other primates, including lemurs. Our aim was to determine the relationship between allostatic load index (ALI), a measurement of chronic stress, and individual, social, medical and husbandry factors that may impact stress in lemurs housed under human care. Smaller group sizes, a higher percentage of time spent indoors, and more frequent group changes were associated with a higher ALI, indicating that these factors may be associated with chronic stress and potential deleterious health effects. This research presents support for ALI as a tool to help us better understand and mitigate stress in animals under our care. Responses to stress are unavoidable, adaptive mechanisms in humans and non-human animals. However, in humans, chronic stress has been linked to poor health outcomes and early mortality. Allostatic load, the physiologic dysregulation that occurs when an organism is exposed to chronic stressors, has been used to assess stress in humans; less work has been done using non-human primates. Our aim was to determine the relationship between allostatic load in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) under human care and potentially stressful individual, social, medical and husbandry factors, as well a sex and age. An allostatic load index (ALI) was calculated for 38 lemurs using six biomarkers measured in serum (albumin, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, DNA damage, glucose and prostaglandin E2). Potentially stressful factors were recorded over the lifetime of each lemur using medical and husbandry records. Animals with a higher percentage of time spent indoors, those kept in smaller average group sizes, and those with fewer minor group composition changes had, or tended to have, higher ALI. There was no relationship between ALI and sex or age. Some social and husbandry factors were associated with allostatic load in lemurs, indicating that this index may be a useful tool in assessing and determining factors contributing to stress of lemurs and other animals under human care.}},

We tested whether long calls serve to communicate a male's ever-changing predominant travel direction to facilitate maintaining these associations. We found that the direction in which a flanged male emits his long calls predicts his subsequent travel direction for many hours, and that a new call indicates a change in his main travel direction. Long calls given at or near the night nest indicate travel direction better than random until late afternoon on the next day. These results show that male orangutans make their travel plans well in advance and announce them to conspecifics.

First, we examined the accuracy of the line transect method. We found that the densities based on a pass in both directions of two experienced pairs of observers was 27\% below a combined sample based on transect walks by eight pairs of observers, suggesting that regular line-transect densities may seriously underestimate true densities. Second, we compared these results with those obtained by nest counts in 0.2-ha plots. This method produced an estimated 15.24 nests/ha, as compared to 10.0 and 10.9, respectively, by two experienced pairs of observers who walked a line transect in both directions. Third, we estimated orangutan densities based on female home range size and overlap and the proportion of females in the population, which produced a density of 4.25–4.5 individuals/km2 . Converting nest densities into orangutan densities, using locally estimated parameters for nest production rate and proportion of nest builders in the population, we found that density estimates based on the line transect results of the most experienced pairs on a double pass were 2.82 and 3.08 orangutans/km2, based on the combined line transect data are 4.04, and based on plot counts are 4.30.

abstract = {{Previous work has shown that dominant primates in stable social hierarchies in a number of species often have low basal cortisol concentrations, relative to subordinate individuals. In contrast, this trait appears to be lost during periods of social instability, probably reflecting the psychological stressfulness of the instability. The present study examined whether basal cortisol concentrations were elevated not only when the overall hierarchy was unstable, but also were elevated in individuals which, within a stable hierarchy, were nevertheless in the process of their own rank shifting. Study subjects were a population of male olive baboons living freely in a national reserve in East Africa, which could be anesthetized under conditions allowing for determination of basal cortisol concentrations. The instability of a particular rank was quantified by determining the percentage of dominance interactions that represented a reversal of the already established direction of dominance.Highly unstable relationships with the rest of the males in the hierarchy did not predict elevated basal cortisol concentrations in an individual. Instead, it was the stability of interactions with males close in rank (within three steps in the hierarchy of the individual) which predicted cortisol concentrations: the greater the percentage of interactions that were reversals with the three nearest lower-ranking males, the higher the basal cortisol concentrations in an individual. In general, high rates of such reversal interactions indicated that the male was being challenged for his more dominant position.In contrast, basal cortisol concentrations were not related to the extent of instability in a male's interactions with the three nearest higher-ranking males; high rates of such interactions indicated that the male instead was challenging those ahead of him in the hierarchy. Thus, the present data show that rank instability is not always an addrenocortical stimulant; it depends on whether the instability implies that the male is rising or declining in the hierarchy.}},

Findings derive from ca 600 h observational data on nesting skills and nesting associations in Kaja’s 42 resident rehabilitants, which yielded 355 nests and 125 leaf-carrying cases by 34 rehabilitants. Regional contrasts with 14 other communities (7 rehabilitant, 7 wild) indicated cultural influences on leaf-carrying on Kaja. Association data showed exceptional social learning opportunities for leaf-carrying on Kaja, with residents taking differential advantage of these opportunities as a function of development, experience, and social position. Juvenile males with basic nesting skills were most influenced by social input. Most (27) leaf-carriers had probably learned leaf-carrying when caged and 7 probably learned it on Kaja. Social priming was probably the main impetus to leaf-carrying on Kaja, by simply prompting observers to copy when leaf-carrying associates collected nesting materials, what they collected, and where they used their collected materials. Implications concern acquisition processes and ontogenetic schedules that orchestrate sets of features—needs or interests, cognitive abilities, social preferences—which enable cultural transmission.}},

Because sperm phenotype is under post-copulatory sexual selection, we hypothesized that a reduced intramale variation in sperm size is associated with sperm competitiveness in red deer. Our results show that low variation in sperm size is strongly related to high sperm velocity and normal sperm morphology, which in turn are good predictors of male fertility in this species. Furthermore, it is well known that the red deer show high variability in testicular mass but there is limited knowledge concerning the significance of this phenomenon at intraspecific level, even though it may reveal interesting processes of sexual selection. Thereby, as a preliminary result, we found that absolute testes mass is negatively associated with intramale variation in sperm size. Our findings suggest that sperm size variation in red deer is under a strong selective force leading to increase sperm function efficiency, and reveal new insights into sexual selection mechanisms.}},

A major risk associated with small population size is inbreeding depression. The effects of inbreeding upon male reproductive traits are the subject of an ongoing controversy, since the evidence linking lack of genetic variability and poor ejaculate quality at the population level has been criticized recently by several authors. We report that among Gazella cuvieri males, inbreeding coefficient shows a strong inverse relationship with ejaculate quality.

Most of what we know about the life‐history patterns and social structure of gorillas comes from studies of eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei sp.), which live under dramatically different ecological conditions compared to western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla sp.). In this paper we present new data on western gorilla social structure and life histories from four study sites, and make comparisons with eastern gorilla populations. Data were obtained from two study sites with gorilla groups undergoing the habituation process (Lossi, Democratic Republic of Congo and Bai Hokou, Central African Republic) and two “bai” studies (Maya Nord and Mbeli Bai, Republic of Congo). The size and structure of these groups were similar to those seen in eastern gorillas. However, differences in the occurrence of various group transitions (group formations, changes between one‐male and multimale composition, and group disintegrations) exist, and western gorillas notably exhibit much higher rates of male emigration and correspondingly fewer multimale groups compared to mountain gorillas. Certain phenomena have been observed only rarely, including predation by leopards. The preliminary data show no significant differences in birth rates between western gorillas and mountain gorillas. The ecological variability across gorilla habitats likely explains the flexibility in the social system of gorillas, but we need more information on the social relationships and ecology of western gorillas to elucidate the causes for the similarities and differences between western and eastern gorillas on the levels of individuals, social groups, and population dynamics.

A fundamental frequency analysis program (SEARP) was used to measure mean fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, and phonation range from samples of connected speech and sustained vowel production. Subjects in good physical condition produced maximum duration vowel phonation with significantly less jitter and shimmer and had larger phonation ranges than did subjects of similar chronological ages who were in poor physical condition.

Femoral perfusion was lower in old animals, as well as endothelium‐dependent vasodilation and NO bioavailability. These effects could contribute to old age—related bone loss and the increased risk of fracture. Introduction: Aging has been shown to diminish bone blood flow in rats and humans. The purpose of this study was to determine whether blood flow to regions of the femur perfused primarily through the principal nutrient artery (PNA) are diminished with aging and whether this putative reduction in flow is associated with impaired endothelium‐dependent vasodilation. Materials and Methods: Blood flow was measured in conscious young adult (4–6 mo old) and aged (24–26 mo old) male Fischer‐344 rats using radiolabeled microspheres. Endothelium‐dependent vasodilation of the PNA was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine (ACh), whereas the contribution of the NO synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) signaling pathways to endothelium‐dependent vasodilation was determined using the NOS and COX inhibitors L‐NAME and indomethacin, respectively. Results: Femoral blood flow in the aged rats was 21\% and 28\% lower in the proximal and distal metaphyses, respectively, and 45\% lower in the diaphyseal marrow. Endothelium‐dependent vasodilation was reduced with old age (young: 83 ± 6\% maximal relaxation; aged: 62 ± 5\% maximal relaxation), whereas endothelium‐independent vasodilation (sodium nitroprusside) was unaffected by age. The reduction in endothelium‐dependent vasodilation was mediated through impairment of the NOS signaling pathway, which resulted in lower NO bioavailability (young: 168 ± 56 nM; aged: 50 ± 7 nM). Conclusions: These data show that reductions in metaphyseal bone and diaphyseal marrow perfusion with old age are associated with diminished endothelium‐dependent vasodilation through an impairment of the NOS mechanism. Such age‐related changes in bone perfusion and vascular NO signaling could impact clinical bone loss, increase risk of fracture, and impair fracture healing in the elderly.}},

abstract = {{Bimaturism in orangutans is defined as two different secondary sexual characteristics of a mature male, unflanged and flanged. Bimaturism has been hypothesized to be condition-dependent, which includes how social interactions, energetic status, and physiological status regulate flange development. Yet we still have little understanding of what triggers the development of secondary sexual characteristics in adult males and why there is such of variation in the timing of flanging. This study examined relationships between social behavior, energy intake, and endocrinological hormones to flange development in Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii). By quantifying the orangutans’ flange size from three different male’s developmental stages (unflanged, developing flange, and flanged), I observed that 1) Bimaturism in orangutans is provoked by social interactions. Social interactions were related to the size of the orangutans’ flange such that males with smaller flanges tended to have greater interactions. Moreover, the amount of social interactions was related to the cortisol production in males with greater flange size. 2) Bimaturism in orangutans is not nutrient-dependent. Total energy intake did not differ among developmental stages and by accounting body mass per Kg, flanged males tended to have the lowest energy intake compared to other stages. 3) Bimaturism in orangutans seems to be influenced by endocrinological status. High testosterone levels were correlated to the flange development, and elevated cortisol levels were highest in unflanged males and may have inhibited flange development.}},

To improve our understanding of the species survival within ongoing project construction, we conducted population density monitoring prior- to post-construction time frames within the hydroelectric dam project. Also, we carried out spatial analysis to understand the land cover change and orangutan’s suitable habitat distribution. This study found that during high construction activities, orangutans were avoiding the threat sources, and returned when the disturbances reduced. These findings indicated orangutans are ecology flexible and have the capability to increase its survival, although the company’s involvement is crucial to facilitate the successes.

Such flexible developmental arrest is unique among male primates. Among male Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) such long delays appear less common. Here, we develop a simple model to identify the conditions under which developmental arrest can be adaptive. We show that the baseline strategy (i.e., males are not susceptible to arrest) cannot be invaded by the flexible strategy (i.e., males can arrest their development when the conditions are unfavorable) when the potential for high‐ranking unflanged or flanged males to monopolize sexual access to females is low. In contrast, at high monopolization potential, the flexible strategy is the evolutionarily stable strategy. We also derive the proportion of flanged males in the population for each combination of monopolization values. This model concurs with field data that found a different monopolization potential between Bornean and Sumatran flanged males and a lower proportion of flanged males in the population in Sumatran orangutans. Pronounced developmental arrest is linked to very low adult mortality, which explains why it is so limited in its taxonomic distribution. Am J Phys Anthropol 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

We analyze how 12 forest attributes recover during secondary succession and how their recovery is interrelated using 77 sites across the tropics. Tropical forests are highly resilient to low-intensity land use; after 20 years, forest attributes attain 78\% (33 to 100\%) of their old-growth values. Recovery to 90\% of old-growth values is fastest for soil (<1 decade) and plant functioning (<2.5 decades), intermediate for structure and species diversity (2.5 to 6 decades), and slowest for biomass and species composition (>12 decades). Network analysis shows three independent clusters of attribute recovery, related to structure, species diversity, and species composition. Secondary forests should be embraced as a low-cost, natural solution for ecosystem restoration, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation.}},

abstract = {{Body weight dimorphism in anthropoid primates has been thought to be a consequence of sexual selection resulting from male‐male competition for access to mates. However, while monogamous anthropoids show low degrees of weight dimorphism, as predicted by the sexual selection hypothesis, polygynous anthropoids show high variation in weight dimorphism that is not associated with measures of mating system or sex ratio. This observation has led many to debate the role of other factors such as dietary constraints, predation pressure, substrate constraints, allometric effects, and phylogeny in the evolution of anthropoid weight dimorphism. Here, we re‐evaluate variation in adult body weight dimorphism in anthropoids, testing the sexual selection hypothesis using categorical estimates of the degree of male‐male intrasexual competition (“competition levels”). We also test the hypotheses that interspecific variation in body weight dimorphism is associated with female body weight and categorical estimates of diet, substrate use, and phylogeny. Weight dimorphism is strongly associated with competition levels, corroborating the sexual selection hypothesis. Weight dimorphism is positively correlated with increasing female body weight, but evidence suggests that the correlation reflects an interaction between overall size and behavior. Arboreal species are, on average, less dimorphic than terrestrial species, while more frugivorous species tend to be more dimorphic than folivorous or insectivorous species. Several alternative hypotheses can explain these latter results. Weight dimorphism is correlated with taxonomy, but so too are competition levels. We suggest that most taxonomic correlations of weight dimorphism represent “phylogenetic niche conservatism”; however, colobines show consistently low degrees of weight dimorphism for reasons that are not clear.

We performed detailed acoustic analyses of the spectral and temporal characteristics of marmoset vocalizations during development, comparing differences between genders and twin pairs, as well as with vocalizations from adult marmosets residing in the same colony. Our analyses revealed significant changes in spectral and temporal features as well as variability of particular call types over time. Infant and juvenile vocalizations changed progressively toward the vocalizations produced by adult marmosets. Call types observed early in development that were unique to infants disappeared gradually with age, while vocal exchanges with conspecifics emerged. Our observations clearly indicate that marmoset vocalizations undergo both qualitative and quantitative postnatal changes, establishing the basis for further studies to delineate contributions from maturation of the vocal apparatus and behavioral experience.}},

Likewise, it is often unknown which factors (e.g., resource holding potential, age, physical condition) affect a male's dominance rank. Here we investigated correlates of male rank and hierarchy characteristics in Nepal gray langurs (Semnopithecus schistaceus), a population with high male reproductive skew, and compared the results to other multi‐male groups of nonhuman primates. We collected dyadic displacement interactions from two groups (mean 3.0 and 4.1 adult males) for five years each. We assessed dominance ranks for demographically stable phases (n = 11, n = 28) and analyzed the effects of age and physical condition through linear mixed models (LMM). We analyzed hierarchy characteristics via the program MatMan. We used data from 27 primate groups (cercopithecines, colobines, hominoids) as a comparative sample. The highest ranks were attained by adults in one group (LMM, P < 0.091) and by young adults in the other group (LMM, P < 0.001). With some exceptions, rank was highest for males with higher physical condition scores (LMM, P < 0.05). Hierarchies had high directional consistency (mean > 0.93) and linearity (mean >0.81) and were relatively steep (mean >0.66) when compared with other species. Dominance rank followed a pattern predicted by resource holding potential, but other individual attributes and group composition also seemed important. As predicted, hierarchy characteristics indicated a despotic system in line with the strong reproductive skew. Across primates, however, the degree of despotism did not appear to match the degree of reproductive skew. Am J Phys Anthropol 160:208–219, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

The majority of studies in chimpanzees support homologous face-processing mechanisms with humans, but results from monkey studies appear largely dependent on the type of testing methods used. Studies that employ passive viewing paradigms, like the visual paired comparison task, report evidence of similarities between monkeys and humans, but tasks that use more stringent, operant response tasks, like the matching-to-sample task, often report species differences. Moreover, the data suggest that monkeys may be less sensitive than chimpanzees and humans to the precise spacing of facial features, in addition to the surface-based cues reflected in those features, information that is critical for the representation of individual identity. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the available data from face-processing tasks in non-human primates with the goal of understanding the evolution of this complex cognitive skill.}},

In their natural state, lowland tropical peatlands support a luxuriant growth of peat swamp forest overlying peat deposits up to 20 metres thick4,5. Persistent environmental change—in particular, drainage and forest clearing—threatens their stability2, and makes them susceptible to fire6. This was demonstrated by the occurrence of widespread fires throughout the forested peatlands of Indonesia7,8,9,10 during the 1997 El Niño event. Here, using satellite images of a 2.5 million hectare study area in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, from before and after the 1997 fires, we calculate that 32\% (0.79 Mha) of the area had burned, of which peatland accounted for 91.5\% (0.73 Mha). Using ground measurements of the burn depth of peat, we estimate that 0.19–0.23 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon were released to the atmosphere through peat combustion, with a further 0.05 Gt released from burning of the overlying vegetation. Extrapolating these estimates to Indonesia as a whole, we estimate that between 0.81 and 2.57 Gt of carbon were released to the atmosphere in 1997 as a result of burning peat and vegetation in Indonesia. This is equivalent to 13–40\% of the mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and contributed greatly to the largest annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration detected since records began in 1957 (ref. 1).}},

We assess variation in muscle mass by examining the relationship between urinary creatinine and specific gravity and use the residuals as a non-invasive measure of estimated lean body mass (ELBM). Despite orangutans having a suite of adaptations to buffer them from fruit scarcity and associated caloric deficits, ELBM was lower during low fruit periods in all age-sex classes. As predicted, adult male orangutans had higher ELBM than adult females and immatures. Contrary to expectation, flanged and unflanged males did not differ significantly in ELBM.

During phases of social stability, when dominance positions are clear and unchallenged, subordinates often face higher costs in terms of social stress than dominant individuals. In this study we test this prediction and examine additional potential correlates of stress, such as reproductive season, age and amount of aggression received in wild, seasonally breeding Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis). During a mating and a non-mating season we collected 394 h of focal observational data and 440 fecal samples of six adult and six large subadult males living in a multimale–multifemale group in their natural habitat in northeastern Thailand. The mating season was characterized by a general increase in aggressive behavior and glucocorticoid excretion across all males compared to the non-mating season. Among adult males, mating season glucocorticoid levels were significantly negatively related with dominance rank and positively with the amount of aggression received. Both relationships were non-significant among large subadult males. Thus, our results suggest that in adult Assamese macaques a high dominance position is not associated with high costs. Low costs of dominance might be induced by strong social bonds among top-ranking males, which exchange frequent affiliative interactions and serve as allies in coalitionary aggression against potentially rank-challenging subordinate males.}},

abstract = {{Sexual dimorphism in the primate face has been studied intensively lately, but a number of issues remain controversial. For example, some studies have indicated that facial sexual dimorphism arises through ontogenetic scaling, whereas others have found it to be a consequence of both ontogenetic scaling and divergence in male and female growth trajectories. To shed further light on primate facial sexual dimorphism, geometric morphometric methods were applied to crania representing five papionin genera: Cercocebus, Lophocebus, Macaca, Mandrillus and Papio. A first set of analyses focused on the pattern and degree of facial sexual dimorphism exhibited by adult specimens. A second set of analyses concentrated on the ontogeny of facial sexual dimorphism in infant‐to‐adult age series. The first set indicated that the five genera exhibit significant facial sexual dimorphism. These analyses also revealed that the genera share several features of sexual dimorphism. Males are distinguished from females in having a more prognathic mid‐face, a relatively more inferiorly and anteriorly positioned prosthion, relatively increased subnasal height and relatively broader zygomatic roots. They are also differentiated from females in their maxillae, which relative to the zygomatics are narrow but vertically deep, especially in the posterior aspect. Also, the first set of analyses indicated that Macaca is the most distinctive of the genera in terms of sexual dimorphism. The distinctive features of the Macaca sexual dimorphism are that males exhibit relatively wider nasal apertures and premaxillae than females, together with a relative increase in breadth across the inferior zygomatic roots. The second set of analyses demonstrated that in all the genera, sexual dimorphism arises partly through ontogenetic scaling and partly through a late divergence in male and female growth trajectories. The analyses also indicated that the relative contribution of these processes to sexual dimorphism varies among the genera. Ontogenetic scaling is by far the most important process in Lophocebus and Papio. Late divergence between male and female growth trajectories contributes proportionately more in Cercocebus and Mandrillus, although ontogenetic scaling still plays the major role. The relative contribution of late divergence between male and female growth trajectories is greatest in Macaca, in which it accounts for about half of the facial differences between adult males and females. In all five genera, ontogenetic scaling results in increased prognathism and greater relative maxillary size in males compared to females, whilst the late divergence involves the male mid‐face becoming proportionately larger and deeper than the female mid‐face, and the male posterior maxilla coming to lie more inferiorly with respect to the zygomatic root than its female counterpart.}},

Orangutans have the slowest life history and the longest period of dependency of all primates. As members of a semisolitary species with high levels of sexual coercion, adolescent female orangutans face a unique combination of challenges when achieving independence from their mother. This study examined the mating behavior of adolescent female orangutans and compared it with that of adult females to assess whether mating behavior reflects distinct strategies at these different points in the life cycle. Data were collected in Gunung Palung National Park on the island of Borneo over 20 years. Mating events from adolescent (n = 19) and adult females (n = 26) were scored and compared. Adolescent female mating events had significantly higher mating scores (indicating more proceptivity) than those of adult females (β = 1.948, p = .001). Adolescent females also engaged in elaborate sociosexual interactions with different flanged males, behaviors that were never observed during mating events of adult females. These interactions involved characteristic behavior on the part of both the adolescent females and the flanged males. Given these findings and the documentation of similar accounts of adolescent female–flanged male mating from the island of Sumatra, we propose that adolescent female orangutans display distinctive behavioral repertoires throughout the genus Pongo which serves to overcome male ambivalence toward nulliparous females, establish familiarity, and evaluate coercive tendencies in flanged males. We suggest that these behavioral patterns are an integral part of female social development in a female philopatric, but highly dispersed species where consistent social support is absent after ranging independence is achieved.

abstract = {{ Orangutans (Pongo spp.) are reported to have extremely slow life histories, including the longest average interbirth intervals of all mammals. Such slow life history can be viable only when unavoidable mortality is kept low. Thus, orangutans' survivorship under natural conditions is expected to be extremely high. Previous estimates of orangutan life history were based on captive individuals living under very different circumstances or on small samples from wild populations. Here, we combine birth data from seven field sites, each with demographic data collection for at least 10 years (range 12–43 years) on wild orangutans to better document their life history. Using strict criteria for data inclusion, we calculated infant survival, interbirth intervals and female age at first reproduction, across species, subspecies and islands. We found an average closed interbirth interval of 7.6 years, as well as consistently very high pre-weaning survival for males and females. Female survival of 94\% until age at first birth (at around age 15 years) was higher than reported for any other mammal species under natural conditions. Similarly, annual survival among parous females is very high, but longevity remains to be estimated. Current data suggest no major life history differences between Sumatran and Bornean orangutans. The high offspring survival is remarkable, noting that modern human populations seem to have reached the same level of survival only in the 20th century. The orangutans' slow life history illustrates what can be achieved if a hominoid bauplan is exposed to low unavoidable mortality. Their high survival is likely due to their arboreal and non-gregarious lifestyle, and has allowed them to maintain viable populations, despite living in low-productivity habitats. However, their slow life history also implies that orangutans are highly vulnerable to a catastrophic population crash in the face of drastic habitat change.}},

abstract = {{Sex differences in diet, ranging, and activity budgets (‘ecology’) can have two plausible, non-exclusive causes: differential needs due to reproduction in females and differences in body size, as well as sex differences in sociosexual strategies, usually because males are forced to travel more widely or minimize feeding time relative to females. The authors of this chapter evaluated these two hypotheses by examining sex differences in the ecology of orangutans inhabiting a Sumatran swamp forest, using two different methods. The greater reproductive burden on females is reflected in their spending more time per day feeding overall, more time foraging on insects, and less time resting, but females did not engage more in tool-assisted foraging or less in acquiring vertebrate meat. Despite the large range of body sizes, the influence of body size on time budgets, diet and the toughness and elasticity of food items was minor. However, larger males spent more time feeding on fruit than smaller ones. The other differences between unflanged males and flanged males were more compatible with different sociosexual strategies: unflanged males moved more and travelled faster than flanged males, and had shorter feeding bouts. Thus, the overall pattern of differences largely reflects sex differences in requirements due to reproduction and male sociosexual strategies. The effects of body size on diet may be so small because tooth morphology rather than body strength determine food choice.}},

These strips have been used to detect ketosis as a marker of fat catabolism in several primate taxa in their natural environments in response to changing food availability. However, the use of urine strips to determine ketosis has only been validated in human studies, and thus it remains unclear whether these strips accurately detect and quantify ketone bodies in nonhuman primates. We examined variations in ketone body concentrations in urine samples collected from wild Bornean orangutans at the Tuanan Orangutan Research Station. We assessed the accuracy of qualitative results from Chemstrip test strips in the field (i.e., negative, small, moderate, and large) using an enzyme-linked assay in the laboratory to determine the concentrations of acetoacetate of the same urine samples. Urine samples that tested positive for ketones in the field had significantly higher levels of ketones in the enzymatic assay compared to those that tested negative. There was significant variation in acetoacetate concentrations among the 4 Chemstrip values; however, post hoc tests revealed no significant differences between negative and small samples. We conclude that urinary test strips provide a useful tool for determining ketotic state in wild orangutans, but caution should be taken when interpreting results from samples showing only small levels of ketones on these strips.}},

abstract = {{Six extant species of non-human great apes are currently recognized: Sumatran and Bornean orangutans, eastern and western gorillas, and chimpanzees and bonobos [1]. However, large gaps remain in our knowledge of fine-scale variation in hominoid morphology, behavior, and genetics, and aspects of great ape taxonomy remain in flux. This is particularly true for orangutans (genus: Pongo), the only Asian great apes and phylogenetically our most distant relatives among extant hominids [1]. Designation of Bornean and Sumatran orangutans, P. pygmaeus (Linnaeus 1760) and P. abelii (Lesson 1827), as distinct species occurred in 2001 [1, 2]. Here, we show that an isolated population from Batang Toru, at the southernmost range limit of extant Sumatran orangutans south of Lake Toba, is distinct from other northern Sumatran and Bornean populations. By comparing cranio-mandibular and dental characters of an orangutan killed in a human-animal conflict to those of 33 adult male orangutans of a similar developmental stage, we found consistent differences between the Batang Toru individual and other extant Ponginae. Our analyses of 37 orangutan genomes provided a second line of evidence. Model-based approaches revealed that the deepest split in the evolutionary history of extant orangutans occurred ∼3.38 mya between the Batang Toru population and those to the north of Lake Toba, whereas both currently recognized species separated much later, about 674 kya. Our combined analyses support a new classification of orangutans into three extant species. The new species, Pongo tapanuliensis, encompasses the Batang Toru population, of which fewer than 800 individuals survive. Video Abstract}},

abstract = {{Fluctuating asymmetry occurs when an individual is unable to undergo identical development of an otherwise bilaterally symmetric trait on both sides of its body. Since both sides of a bilaterally symmetric trait are the result of the actions of a single genome, fluctuating asymmetry represents an epigenetic measure of the sensitivity of development to stress. Different morphological traits may show a direct relationship between their functional importance and their degree of developmental canalization. This may explain why some characters show high degrees of fluctuating asymmetry, and why these characters more often become exaggerated secondary sexual ornaments. The degree of fluctuating asymmetry is generally larger in small marginal populations living in novel environments, and this will particularly lead to relatively large degrees of asymmetry in the least developmentally canalized traits. More stringent selection against heterozygotes in marginal populations may further break down developmental stability and linkage groups which would lead to increased genetic variance. Females may prefer to mate with males having large, but relatively symmetric morphological characters, because it is more difficult to make large traits (a good genes argument), a large trait is more easily perceived (a sensory bias preference), and because symmetry signals ability to cope with stress (a good genes argument). The low degree of developmental stability and the large amount of genetic variance in secondary sexual characters in small, marginal populations could set the scene for rapid development of divergence and speciation in marginal populations.}},

abstract = {{Considerable evidence suggests that the steroid hormone testosterone mediates major life-history trade-offs in vertebrates, promoting mating effort at the expense of parenting effort or survival. Observations from a range of wild primates support the “Challenge Hypothesis,” which posits that variation in male testosterone is more closely associated with aggressive mating competition than with reproductive physiology. In both seasonally and non-seasonally breeding species, males increase testosterone production primarily when competing for fecund females. In species where males compete to maintain long-term access to females, testosterone increases when males are threatened with losing access to females, rather than during mating periods. And when male status is linked to mating success, and dependent on aggression, high-ranking males normally maintain higher testosterone levels than subordinates, particularly when dominance hierarchies are unstable. Trade-offs between parenting effort and mating effort appear to be weak in most primates, because direct investment in the form of infant transport and provisioning is rare. Instead, infant protection is the primary form of paternal investment in the order. Testosterone does not inhibit this form of investment, which relies on male aggression. Testosterone has a wide range of effects in primates that plausibly function to support male competitive behavior. These include psychological effects related to dominance striving, analgesic effects, and effects on the development and maintenance of the armaments and adornments that males employ in mating competition.}},

Results indicated that adult male chimpanzees showed significant testosterone increases during periods when parous females showed maximally tumescent sexual swellings. These periods were also marked by increased rates of male aggression. Male testosterone levels did not increase in the presence of maximally tumescent nulliparous females. Such females are less attractive to males: they are not mate-guarded, nor do rates of male aggression increase when they are swelling. Male chimpanzees copulate with parous and nulliparous females at similar rates, however, suggesting that testosterone increases in the presence of cycling parous females are associated with aggression rather than sexual behaviour. High-ranking chimpanzees were more aggressive than low-ranking males and produced higher levels of urinary testosterone. Thus, the predictions of the challenge hypothesis were generally upheld. This suggests that the hypothesis may have wider applicability among primates, including humans.}},

The findings were consistent with the male-spacing hypothesis but did not support the mate-attraction hypothesis. Experimental playbacks demonstrate that long calls regulate spacing between males through an approach-avoidance system based on dominance relationships: the highest-ranking adult male approaches calls, while lower-ranking, males avoid calls. The results of playbacks also reveal that sexually active females do not move toward long calls, and therefore do not indicate that long calls function in attracting mates.

So far, it has remained uninvestigated to what extent orangutan mothers are actively involved in this learning process. From a fitness point of view, it may be adaptive for mothers to facilitate their offspring’s skill acquisition to make them reach nutritional independence faster. Food solicitations are potential means to social learning which, because of their interactive nature, allow to investigate the degree of active involvement of the mother. To investigate the role of food solicitation and the role of the mother in immatures’ foraging skill acquisition, we analysed 1390 food solicitation events between 21 immature Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) and their mothers, collected over 13 years at the Suaq Balimbing orangutan population. We found that solicitation rates decreased with increasing age of the immatures and increased with increasing processing complexity of the food item. Mothers were more likely to share complex items and showed the highest likelihoods of sharing around the age at which immatures are learning most of their feeding skills. Our results indicate that immature Sumatran orangutans use food solicitation to acquire feeding skills. Furthermore, mothers flexibly adjust their behaviour in a way that likely facilitates their offspring’s skill acquisition. We conclude that orangutan mothers have a more active role in the skill acquisition of their offspring than previously thought.}},

Through a non-invasive technique, we analyzed faecal testosterone (FTM 1 1 Fecal testosterone metabolites. ) and cortisol (FCM 2 2 Fecal cortisol metabolites. ) metabolites of dominant and subordinate males from two wild groups of bearded capuchin monkeys. One group had a stable dominance hierarchy while the other had an unstable hierarchy, with a marked conflict period related to a male take-over. In the unstable hierarchy group (1) the dominant male had higher FTM peaks than subordinates, and (2) basal FTM levels were higher than in the stable group. These findings are in accordance with the Challenge Hypothesis and rank-based predictions, and confirm that in Sapajus libidinosus hierarchy stability, social status, aggression rates and testosterone are closely related. Dominants of both groups had higher basal and peak FCM levels, suggesting that in S. libidinosus the dominant male has a higher allostatic load than subordinates, related to his role in protection against predators, intragroup appeasement, and control of food sources. Finally, we suggest that males of S. libidinosus are resistant to testosterone suppression by cortisol, because in the unstable group in spite of an increase in FCM there was also an increase in FTM during the conflict period.

These include the Half-Earth and Whole-Earth visions that respectively seek to set aside half the planet for wildlife conservation or to diversify conservation practices fundamentally and change the economic systems that determine environmental harm. Here we assess these visions in the specific context of Bornean orangutans Pongo pygmaeus and their conservation. Using an expert-led process we explored three scenarios over a 10-year time frame: continuation of Current Conditions, a Half-Earth approach and a Whole-Earth approach. In addition, we examined a 100-year population recovery scenario assuming 0\% offtake of Bornean orangutans. Current Conditions were predicted to result in a population c. 73\% of its current size by 2032. Half-Earth was judged comparatively easy to achieve and predicted to result in an orangutan population of c. 87\% of its current size by 2032. Whole-Earth was anticipated to lead to greater forest loss and ape killing, resulting in a prediction of c. 44\% of the current orangutan population for 2032. Finally, under the recovery scenario, populations could be c. 148\% of their current size by 2122. Although we acknowledge uncertainties in all of these predictions, we conclude that the Half-Earth and Whole-Earth visions operate along different timelines, with the implementation of Whole-Earth requiring too much time to benefit orangutans. None of the theorized proposals provided a complete solution, so drawing elements from each will be required. We provide recommendations for equitable outcomes.}},

As mountain gorilla skeletal material accumulated during the 1970s, researchers noted their pronounced facial asymmetry and hypothesized that it reflects a population-wide chewing side preference. However, asymmetry has also been linked to environmental and genetic stress in experimental models. Here, we examine facial asymmetry in 114 crania from three Gorilla subspecies using 3D geometric morphometrics. We measure fluctuating asymmetry (FA), defined as random deviations from perfect symmetry, and population-specific patterns of directional asymmetry (DA). Mountain gorillas, with a current population size of about 1000 individuals, have the highest degree of facial FA (explaining 17\% of total facial shape variation), followed by Grauer gorillas (9\%) and western lowland gorillas (6\%), despite the latter experiencing the greatest ecological and dietary variability. DA, while significant in all three taxa, explains relatively less shape variation than FA does. Facial asymmetry correlates neither with tooth wear asymmetry nor increases with age in a mountain gorilla subsample, undermining the hypothesis that facial asymmetry is driven by chewing side preference. An examination of temporal trends shows that stress-induced developmental instability has increased over the last 100 years in these endangered apes.}},

First, if the relationship is positive then females could gain a direct benefit by choosing more attractive males for fertility assurance reasons (‘the phenotype‐linked fertility’ hypothesis). Second, there is much interest in the direction of the correlation between traits favoured by pre‐copulatory sexual selection (i.e. affecting mating success) and those favoured by post‐copulatory sexual selection (i.e. increasing sperm competitiveness). If the relationship is negative this could lead to the two forms of selection counteracting each other. Theory predicts that the direction of the relationship could be either positive or negative depending on the underlying genetic variance and covariance in each trait, the extent of variation among males in condition (resources available to allocate to reproductive traits), and variation among males in the cost or rate of mating. We conducted a meta‐analysis to determine the average relationship between the expression of behavioural and morphological male secondary sexual characters and four assays of ejaculate quality (sperm number, viability, swimming speed and size). Regardless of how the data were partitioned the mean relationship was consistently positive, but always statistically non‐significant. The only exception was that secondary sexual character expression was weakly but significantly positively correlated with sperm viability (r = 0.07, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the strength or direction of the relationship between behavioural and morphological SSCs, nor among relationships using the four ejaculate quality assays. The implications of our findings are discussed.}},

A recent study showed significant correlations among nose, body, and testis sizes and clear associations between nose size and the number of females in a male’s harem. However, to date, the analyses of other common male traits, i.e., canines, are lacking. Whereas male nose size had a positive correlation with body size, we unexpectedly found a negative correlation between body and canine sizes. We explain this by an interaction between sexual and natural selection. Larger noses in males may interfere with the use of canines, thereby reducing their effectiveness as weapons. Additionally, longer canines are opposed by natural selection because the larger gape it imposes upon its bearer reduces foraging efficiency, particularly in folivores. This unique case of decoupling of body and canine size reveals that large canines carry an ecological cost. Matsuda et al. examine size correlations in body traits of proboscis monkeys, known for their enlarged noses, and find that while body size and nose size is positively correlated in both sexes, body size is negatively correlated with canine size in males. This study serves as an example of interactions between sexual and natural selection, and morphological traits that act as weapons and adornments.}},

Additionally, the implications of this relationship are discussed in the context of decreasing levels of gonadal steroids in aging males and psychological theories of generalized age-related cognitive decline. Based upon human and non-human research gonadal steroids have organizational effects on visuo-spatial ability in adulthood. Activational effects of gonadal steroids on visuo-spatial ability appear most dominant in older men and are necessary for maintaining optimal visuo-spatial ability; randomized clinical trials show that testosterone supplementation improves performance. Additionally, decreasing gonadal steroid levels in aging males may contribute to generalized age-related cognitive decline. Future supplementation studies in men should attempt to control for constituent abilities related to visuo-spatial task performance, and investigate interactions between dosage levels and baseline gonadal status. Further future animal research is required to investigate changes in gonadal steroid levels and their relationship to neurotransmitter systems, neural plasticity, and behavioral correlates.}},

This suggested a sustained environmental deterioration. However, there was no relation between FA and YOC, or FA and YOCA, in female canines.

Allostatic load can significantly affect the aging process and result in reduced longevity, accelerated aging, and impaired health. Although low socioeconomic status is associated with high allostatic load during aging, the effects of status-related psychosocial stress on allostatic load are often confounded by lifestyle variables. Chronic psychosocial stress associated with low dominance rank in nonhuman primates represents an excellent animal model with which to investigate allostatic load and aging in humans. Research conducted with free-ranging rhesus monkeys suggests that female reproduction can also be a source of stress and allostatic load. Female reproduction is associated with increased risk of mortality and hyperactivation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Reproduction is especially stressful and costly for aging females of low rank. Although many indicators of body condition and neuroendocrine and immune function are influenced by aging, there are marked and stable individual differences among aging females in body condition, plasma cortisol responses to stress, and cytokine responses to stress. These differences are consistent with the hypothesis that there are strong differences in chronic stress among individuals, and that allostatic load resulting from chronic stress affects health during aging. Comparisons between captive and free-ranging rhesus monkey populations may allow us to understand how differences in environmental stress and allostatic load affect rates of aging, and how these in turn translate into differences in longevity and health.}},

Focusing on three elements of social behaviour and cognition that are important for humans—propensities to engage with others, the positive versus negative valence of these interactions, and capabilities to influence others, we find evidence for wide variation in the trajectories of these characteristics across primates. Based on this, we identify potential modulators of the primate social ageing process, including social organization, sex and dominance status.

Recent studies show that if the most weaponized males can monopolize access to females through contest competition, thereby reducing the risk of sperm competition, they tend to invest less in sperm production. However, how males invest in sexual ornaments relative to sperm production remains less clear. If male ornaments serve as badges of status, with high-ranking males attaining near-exclusive access to females, similar to monopolizing females through combat, their expression should also covary negatively with investment in post-mating traits. In a comparative study across primates, which exhibit considerable diversification in sexual ornamentation, male weaponry and testes size, we found relative testes size to decrease with sexual ornaments but increase with canine size. These contrasting evolutionary trajectories might be driven by differential selection, functional constraints or temporal patterns of metabolic investment between the different types of sexual traits. Importantly, however, our results indicate that the theory of relative investments between weapons and testes in the context of monopolizing females can extend to male ornaments.}},

abstract = {{Abstract After providing an introductory overview of socioemotional selectivity theory, we review empirical evidence for its basic postulates and consider the implications of the predicted cognitive and behavioral changes for physical health. The main assertion of socioemotional selectivity theory is that when boundaries on time are perceived, present‐oriented goals related to emotional meaning are prioritized over future‐oriented goals aimed at acquiring information and expanding horizons. Such motivational changes, which are strongly correlated with chronological age, systematically influence social preferences, social network composition, emotion regulation, and cognitive processing. On the one hand, there is considerable reason to believe that such changes are good for well‐being and social adjustment. On the other hand, the very same motivational changes may limit health‐related information‐seeking and influence attention, memory, and decision‐making such that positive material is favored over negative information. Grounding our arguments in socioemotional selectivity theory, we consider possible ways to tailor contexts such that disadvantages are avoided.}},

Despite the many similarities, there are significant differences in aging among apes, including the human ape. Common to all are dental attrition, periodontitis, tooth loss, osteopenia, and arthritis, although gout is uniquely human and spondyloarthropathy is more prevalent in apes than humans. Humans are more prone to frailty, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, longevity past reproductive senescence, loss of brain volume, and Alzheimer dementia. Cerebral vascular disease occurs in both humans and apes. Cardiovascular disease mortality increases in aging humans and apes, but coronary atherosclerosis is the most significant type in humans. In captive apes, idiopathic myocardial fibrosis and cardiomyopathy predominate, with arteriosclerosis of intramural coronary arteries. Similar cardiac lesions are occasionally seen in wild apes. Vascular changes in heart and kidneys and aortic dissections in gorillas and bonobos suggest that hypertension may be involved in pathogenesis. Chronic kidney disease is common in elderly humans and some aging apes and is linked with cardiovascular disease in orangutans. Neoplasms common to aging humans and apes include uterine leiomyomas in chimpanzees, but other tumors of elderly humans, such as breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers, are uncommon in apes. Among the apes, chimpanzees have been best studied in laboratory settings, and more comparative research is needed into the pathology of geriatric zoo-housed and wild apes. Increasing longevity of humans and apes makes understanding aging processes and diseases imperative for optimizing quality of life in all the ape species.}},

Two prominently studied traits are symmetry and sexual dimorphism, which, for many animals, are proposed cues to heritable fitness benefits. These traits are associated with other potential benefits, such as fertility. In humans, the face has been extensively studied in terms of attractiveness. Faces have the potential to be advertisements of mate quality and both symmetry and sexual dimorphism have been linked to the attractiveness of human face shape. Here we show that measurements of symmetry and sexual dimorphism from faces are related in humans, both in Europeans and African hunter-gatherers, and in a non-human primate. Using human judges, symmetry measurements were also related to perceived sexual dimorphism. In all samples, symmetric males had more masculine facial proportions and symmetric females had more feminine facial proportions. Our findings support the claim that sexual dimorphism and symmetry in faces are signals advertising quality by providing evidence that there must be a biological mechanism linking the two traits during development. Such data also suggests that the signalling properties of faces are universal across human populations and are potentially phylogenetically old in primates.}},

Few studies, however, have examined the attractiveness of specific traits and few have examined preferences in hunter-gatherers. The current study examined preferences for symmetry in both the UK and the Hadza, a hunter-gatherer society of Tanzania. We found that symmetry was more attractive than asymmetry across both the cultures and was more strongly preferred by the Hadza than in the UK. The different ecological conditions may play a role in generating this difference. Such variation in preference may be adaptive if it reflects adaptation to local conditions. Symmetry is thought to indicate genetic quality, which may be more important among the Hadza with much higher mortality rates from birth onwards. Hadza men who were more often named as good hunters placed a greater value on symmetry in female faces. These results suggest that high quality Hadza men are more discriminating in their choice of faces. Hadza women had increased preferences for symmetry in men's faces when they were pregnant or nursing, perhaps due to their increased discrimination and sensitivity to foods and disease harmful to a foetus or nursing infant. These results imply that symmetry is an evolutionarily relevant trait and that variation in symmetry preference appears strategic both between cultures and within individuals of a single culture.}},

In evolutionary terms, there are large and obvious selective advantages in detecting healthy partners, both in terms of avoiding individuals with poor health to minimise contagion and in mating with individuals with high health to help ensure healthy offspring. Many models of sexual selection suggest that an individual's phenotype provides cues to their quality. Fluctuating asymmetry is a trait that is proposed to be an honest indicator of quality, and previous studies have demonstrated that rhesus monkeys gaze longer at symmetric faces, suggesting preferences for such faces. The current study examined the relationship between measured facial symmetry and measures of health in a captive population of female rhesus macaque monkeys. We measured asymmetry from landmarks marked on front-on facial photographs and computed measures of health based on veterinary health and condition ratings, number of minor and major wounds sustained and gain in weight over the first 4 years of life. Analysis revealed that facial asymmetry was negatively related to condition-related health measures, with symmetric individuals being healthier than more asymmetric individuals. Facial asymmetry appears to be an honest indicator of health in rhesus macaques, and asymmetry may then be used by conspecifics in mate-choice situations. More broadly, our data support the notion that faces are valuable sources of information in non-human primates and that sexual selection based on facial information is potentially important across the primate lineage.}},

The correlation between effect size and sample size was negative in almost 80 percent of the meta-analyses examined, and the negative correlation was not limited to a particular type of research or substantive area.

The widely held – yet poorly substantiated ‐ belief that fluctuating asymmetry can act as a universal measure of developmental stability and predictor of stress‐mediated changes in fitness, therefore staggers. Yet attempts to understand why the reported relationships between fluctuating asymmetry, stress and fitness are so heterogeneous – i.e. whether the associations are truly weak or non‐existent or whether they become confounded during different stages of the analytical pathways – remain surprisingly scarce. Hence, we attempt to disentangle these causes, by reviewing the various statistical and conceptual factors that are suspected to confound potential relationships between fluctuating asymmetry, stress and fitness. Two main categories of factors are discerned: those associated with the estimation of developmental stability through fluctuating asymmetry, and those associated with the effects of genotype and environment on developmental stability. Next, we describe a series of statistical tools that have recently been developed to help reduce this noise. We argue that the current lack of a theoretical framework that predicts if and when relationships with developmental stability can be expected, urges for further theoretical and empirical research, such as on the genetic architecture of developmental stability in stressed populations. If the underlying developmental mechanisms are better understood, statistical patterns of asymmetry variation may become a biologically meaningful tool.}},

There is little evidence for specific genes that govern FA per se. Numerous studies show that FA levels in various characters are influenced by dominance and especially epistatic interactions among genes. An epistatic genetic basis for FA may complicate its primary use in comparisons of DI levels in outbred or wild populations subjected or not subjected to various environmental stressors. Although the heritability of FA typically is very low or zero, epistasis can generate additive genetic variation for FA that may allow it to evolve especially in populations subjected to bottlenecks, hybridizations, or periods of rapid environmental changes caused by various stresses.}},

We use two different approaches in Geometric Morphometrics to characterise the degree and patterns of FA and Directional Asymmetry (DA) based on 3D mandibular landmarks. Our results show that the wild and captive groups exhibit morphological dissimilarities in the symmetric component of shape while no significant degree of asymmetry (fluctuating or directional) was detected.

Sexually mature male orangutans have exceptionally long periods of developmental arrest. The two male morphs have been associated with behavioral alternative reproductive tactics, but this interpretation is based on cross‐sectional analyses predominantly of Northwest Sumatran populations. Here we present the first longitudinal analyses of behavioral changes of 10 adult males that have been observed in both unflanged and flanged morph. We also analyzed long‐term behavioral data on an additional 143 individually identified males from two study sites, Suaq (Sumatra, Pongo abelii) and Tuanan (Borneo, Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii), to assess male mating tactics cross‐sectionally in relation to population, male morph (unflanged and flanged), and other socio‐ecological factors. Both our longitudinal and cross‐sectional results confirm and refine previous cross‐sectional accounts of the differences in mating tactics between the unflanged and the flanged male morphs. In the unflanged morph, males exhibit higher sociability, particularly with females, and higher rates of both copulation and sexual coercion than in the flanged morph. Based on our results and those of previous studies showing that females prefer flanged males, and that flanged males have higher reproductive success, we conclude that unflanged males face a trade‐off between avoiding male‐male contest competition and gaining mating access to females, and thus follow a “best‐of‐a‐bad‐job” mating strategy.

Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in western Hudson Bay are under environmental stress from the effects of climate change, such as an increase in the length of the ice-free season, which could destabilize development and decrease symmetry. We examined fluctuating asymmetry in polar bear whisker spot patterns using an image-processing software that extracts whisker spot patterns and calculates their similarity to patterns saved in an image library of known bears. We obtained photographs of both sides of the face of polar bears near Churchill, Manitoba from 2003 to 2005 (n = 24) and 2013 to 2016 (n = 21). We calculated similarity scores for whisker spot patterns and compared them to other photos of the same side of the face of the same bear, to the other side of the face of the same bear, and to the face of another bear. Whisker spot patterns on opposite sides of the face exceeded the threshold similarity score indicating two different bears, and were no more similar than patterns on different bears. These similarity scores suggest fluctuating asymmetry between sides of the bears’ faces. Average asymmetry was greater in 2013–2016 than 2003–2005, suggesting that the degree of fluctuating asymmetry increased between these periods. Using whisker spot analysis from photographs to measure fluctuating asymmetry in live bears experiencing environmental stress illustrates how non-invasive morphometric analysis can be used to address conservation issues in wildlife.}},

Such “developmental arrest” is hypothesized to either reflect a response to experienced high stress (Hypothesis 1), or an adaptation to avoid elevated stress levels and/or having experienced lower stress levels (Hypothesis 2) during early life. As LEH defect depth has been shown to reflect the severity (i.e., intensity and/or duration) of early life stress events, we examined whether unflanged males have shallower LEH defects than flanged males. Flanging status was assessed by measuring the faces of preserved skins. Canine height (N = 37) was measured in the same individuals to assess commonality between morphs. LEH defect depths were analyzed using a standardized confocal profilometry method (N = 34). Flanged males have significantly deeper LEH defects than unflanged adult males. Canine projected crown heights are similar across males regardless of morph. Evidence from great apes shows that, when comparing canines with similar growth patterns, deeper defects reflect more severe stress events during development. Thus, our results suggest that “developmental arrest” of unflanged males is not a response to having experienced stress, but rather an adaptation to avoid the physiological impacts associated with chronic stress and/or experiencing lower stress levels.}},

FA is generally accepted to increase in response to stress; therefore, FA is frequently used in ecological studies as an index of stress experienced by an organism, in particular due to environmental pollution. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that the outcomes of studies based on FA measurements may have been influenced by confirmation bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to seek out evidence in a manner that confirms their hypotheses and beliefs. We collected 100 leaves of downy birch (Betula pubescens) from a single tree, grouped them haphazardly into ten samples, scanned every sample, and then asked each of 31 scientists (experienced in studying FA) to measure FA from the scanned images of all 100 leaves. Three groups of participants were provided with false information about the origin of each sample and about the hypothesis to be tested, and one group (control) was provided with true information. The participants who believed that the leaves originated from a heavily polluted site reported significantly higher values of FA when compared to the participants who believed that the leaves were collected from an unpolluted site. When the participants were told that half the samples originated from a polluted site and half from a clean site and were asked to attribute each sample to either of these sites based on leaf FA, the differences in FA between samples classified as ‘polluted’ and ‘unpolluted’ were much higher than the differences obtained from measurements of the same sets of samples made by the control group. We conclude that when scientists expected to find high FA in some samples, the results of their measurements confirmed their expectations. This effect, classified as confirmation bias, may considerably influence the outcomes of the research on FA. This confirmation bias can be avoided by using a blind method, where the person conducting measurements is not aware of the origin of samples being measured. We argue that the use of blind methods is critically important for any study addressing environmental or genetic impacts on FA.}},

Unflanged males lack the secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., cheek flanges, throat sack, long call) of the flanged males, but are sexually active, fertile and known to sire offspring. In some males, full development may be delayed until they are over 30. This ‘bimaturism’ is hypothesized to have arisen as a result of sexual selection in which female choice, male–male competition and male coercion have all played important roles. The data reviewed here show that male–male competition is highly affected by the reproductive condition of the females and female preference for associating with particular males. Potentially reproductive female orangutans are widely dispersed in space and time. Consequently, dominant flanged adult males cannot easily exert permanent control over access to reproductive females.}},

Orangutans are exceptional among mammals for their high levels of forced copulation. This has typically been viewed as an alternative mating tactic used by the competitively disadvantaged unflanged male morph, with little understanding of how female strategies may have shaped and responded to this behaviour. Here, we show that male morph is not by itself a good predictor of mating dynamics in wild Bornean orangutans but that female conception risk mediated the occurrence and quality of male–female interactions. Near ovulation, females mated cooperatively only with prime flanged males who they encountered at higher rates. When conception risk was low, willingness to associate and mate with non-prime males increased. Our results support the hypothesis that, together with concealed ovulation, facultative association is a mechanism of female choice in a species in which females can rarely avoid coercive mating attempts. Female resistance, which reduced copulation time, may provide an additional mechanism for mate selection. However, coercive factors were also important as prime males were frequently aggressive to females and females used mating strategies consistent with infanticide avoidance.}},

During this period a mast fruiting occurred, resulting in large fluctuations in fruit availability, measured by monitoring of 558 orangutan fruit trees. Orangutan diet varied tremendously in accordance with these fluctuations. During the month of highest fruit production, 100\% of the orangutan diet was composed of fruit. In contrast, during the fruit-poor period as little as 21\% of the diet was fruit, while 37\% was bark. Nutritional analyses of 78 of the foods most commonly eaten during this study show that mast foods were significantly higher in caloric content than were nonmast foods, which translates into substantial changes in caloric intake. During the month of highest fruit consumption (January), males consumed an estimated 8422 kcal/day and females consumed 7404 kcal/day. During the month of lowest fruit consumption (May), males consumed 3824 kcal/day and females consumed 1793 kcal/day. These differences were significantly different between the 2 months for both males and females. In May, males ate significantly more kcal/day than females did. Time spent feeding did not differ between the two periods for either males or females. I assessed the impact of these changes in diet and caloric intake on orangutan physiological functioning by measuring ketones in 257 urine samples collected from adult males and females. Ketones—products of fat metabolism—were present in urine only during the fruit-poor period. These data suggest that orangutans are highly efficient at storing fat during fruit-rich periods and utilizing the reserves during times of fruit shortfall. This response may have important implications for orangutan survivorship, reproduction, and behavior.}},

We used a developmental model of a trait, according to a diffusion‐threshold process, whose parameters are under genetic control. We added a small amount of random variation to the parameter values of this model to simulate developmental noise. As a result of the nonlinearity of the model, different genotypes differed in their sensitivity to developmental noise, even though the noise is completely random and independent of the genotype. The heritable component of FA can thus be understood as genetically modulated expression of variation that is itself entirely nongenetic. The loci responsible for this genetic variation of FA are the same that affect the left/right mean of the trait, showing that genetic variation for FA does not require genes that specifically control FA. Furthermore, the model offers alternative explanations for phenomena widely discussed in the literature on FA, for instance, the correlations between FA and heterozygosity and between FA and trait size. The model underscores the importance of dominance and epistasis, and therefore unites the study of FA with the classical theory of quantitative genetics.}},

This view is still generally accepted (see the textbooks of Scheer, 1969, Kaestner, 1972).

Primate sexually dimorphic canine teeth and body size are two potentially weaponized traits whose function as a signal and/or weapon remains unclear, largely due to the difficulty of collecting detailed measurements of morphology on large free-ranging mammals. Rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, are an interesting study system in which to investigate how such traits function because they experience relatively low levels of direct male–male mating competition compared to other members of their subfamily. Furthermore, male dominance rank is largely based on a queuing system rather than on the outcome of intermale aggressive encounters. We leveraged a novel data set of behavioural observations and morphometric data from free-ranging rhesus macaques to investigate the function of sexually dimorphic canine teeth and body mass as weapons and/or signals. We tested whether canine height or body mass was correlated with dominance rank, whether similarity in any of these factors influenced the occurrence or outcome of agonistic interactions between male–male dyads and whether either of these traits predicted the likelihood of winning an agonistic interaction. Neither canine height nor body mass was related to dominance rank. Similarity in dominance rank, but not in morphology, predicted the occurrence of agonism between dyads. Agonistic encounters between males more similar in dominance rank were more likely to be characterized by aggression rather than submission. Dominance rank, but not canine height or body mass, predicted the likelihood of winning an agonistic interaction. Our results suggest that canine height and body mass do not confer a strong competitive advantage in male rhesus macaques and add to a growing body of evidence indicating that weaponized traits do not always seem to function either in fights or as signals in male–male combat.}},

A survey of eye size, visual acuity and body size of birds and mammals that is consistent with Kirschfeld's suggestion is reported. Hypoallometry (scaling factor < 1) for eye size vs body size combines with hyperallometry (scaling factor > 1) for acuity vs eye size to produce roughly linear scaling between acuity and body size. 2. Kirschfeld (1976) also suggested that the distance at which important objects are typically viewed is a linear function of body length. ‘Subjective distance’ (viewing distance/body length) was therefore thought to be independent of body size across species. However, for prey detection by mammalian and avian predators, it is doubtful that subjective visual distances are size independent because prey size and visual acuity both scale by factors > 0·5 with predator body size; hence, detection distance should scale with size by a factor > 1. Scaling analyses also suggest that subjective visual distances for intraspecific social interactions are size dependent. 3. A positive association between body size and viewing distance has implications for the scaling of coat pattern features. In environments with fractal visual backgrounds (in which perceived sizes of background pattern elements do not change as distance from the background changes), larger animal species should have larger coat patches than smaller species if they are adapted to be cryptic at greater viewing distances than smaller species are.}},

Testosterone is thought to be important in the development of peak bone mass but its role in age-related bone loss is not established. The purpose of this study was to define the predictors of bone mass in healthy older men with low testosterone levels but without symptomatic osteoporosis. Methods. Eighty-three community-dwelling white men, aged more than 65 years old, selected for low bioavailable testosterone levels (≤4.44 nmol/l) participated in a cross-sectional study located at a university general clinical research center. Sex hormone concentrations and markers of bone turnover were assayed in serum and urine. Risk factors for osteoporosis and physical activity were ascertained by physical examination and questionnaire, including the Physical Activity Scale in the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire. Bone mineral densities of the femoral neck (FN BMD), spine, and whole body were measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry. Lower extremity muscle strength (1 repetition maximum) was measured using a leg press machine. Results. Mean bone mineral density values were 0.93 ± 0.14 g/cm2 for femoral neck, 1.31 ± 0.23 g/cm2 for spine, and 1.22 ± 0.12 g/cm2 for whole body. Thirty-one of the 82 subjects (37\%) had t scores <–1 and 12 of 82 subjects (15\%) had t scores <–2.5 at the femoral neck. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that bioavailable testosterone, body mass index (BMI), and PASE scores were positively correlated with, and significant predictors of, femoral neck BMD, accounting for 34.4\% of the variance in FN BMD (F = 10.10, p = .001). Examining each variable independently, bioavailable testosterone accounted for 20.7\%, physical activity score for 9.0\%, and BMI for 6.5\% of FN BMD. Using analysis of variance, mean values for FN BMD were significantly different between men grouped by tertile of bioavailable testosterone (F = 6.192, p = .003). FN BMD mean values were 0.86 ± 0.14 g/cm2 for the lowest tertile, 0.94 ± 0.16 for the middle tertile, and 0.99 ± 0.14 for the highest tertile. Markers of bone turnover were inversely correlated, and strength directly correlated with BMD, but did not contribute to the multiple regression model. Conclusions. Fifty-two percent of older men with low bioavailable testosterone levels had BMD levels below the young adult normal range and are likely at an increased risk of fracture. Bioavailable testosterone, BMI, and physical activity scores were significant determinants of FN BMD in these men. These variables are potentially modifiable and, therefore, amenable to intervention. Hence, our results suggest the need for testosterone replacement and physical activity intervention trials in men at risk for osteoporotic fractures.}},

All traits that increase the probability of obtaining mating opportunities, even minimally, are positively evaluated by intrasexual selection.

The presentation of these adaptations follows the logical chronological sequence of events by distinguishing between pre- and post-copulatory competition.

In bioarchaeological studies, developmental stress can be an important factor for inferring standard of living in a population. However, the crania of a Joseon Dynasty population have only been studied in terms of its morphological characteristics. In this regard, the cranial FA of the two sexes from a Joseon Dynasty population of Korea were compared here for examining their aspects of living conditions in relation to developmental stress and socio-cultural factors. In this study, 77 individuals (39 males and 38 females) who belong to the 15th to the early-20th centuries from Seoul and Gyeonggi province in Korea were investigated. Nineteen three-dimensional landmarks on the vault and basicranium were collected using MicroScribe G2X. The coordinate data were aligned into a common coordinate plane by Procrustes least-squares superimposition. Procrustes ANOVA was adopted to evaluate FA at a population level. The FA of males and females were compared with t-test using SPSS 18. There was statistically insignificant difference in FA between the two sexes in the Joseon Dynasty population. The result was interpreted to reflect both relatively high developmental stress and sex-related discrimination in the population. It was postulated that relatively high developmental stress could increase difference in FA between the two sexes in the prenatal term compared to the postnatal term because sex-related discrimination cannot be practiced before birth and males have lower stress resistance than females. Then, the difference between the two sexes in the cranial FA could be decreased during postnatal development related to sex-related discrimination, resulting in insignificant FA difference of the two sexes in spite of high developmental stress of the Joseon Dynasty population. The results will be useful for comparing and reconstructing living conditions of ancient Korean populations.}},

Condition was scored on a scale from 0: full, fluffy coat with guard hairs present, to 5: half or more of body hairless. Adult males did not differ overall from adult females. Coats were worse in adults than in 2‐year‐old subadults; 1‐year‐old juveniles were intermediate.

abstract = {{The orang utan (Pongo pygmaeus), as currently recognized, includes two geographically separated subspecies: Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus, which resides on Borneo, and P. p. abelii, which inhabits Sumatra. At present, there is no known route of gene flow between the two populations except through captive individuals which have been released back into the wild over the last several decades. The two subspecies are differentiated by morphological and behavioral characters, and they can be distinguished by a subspecies specific pericentric chromosomal inversion. Nei-genetic distances were estimated between orang utan subspecies, gorilla, chimpanzee and humans using 44 isozyme loci and using 458 soluble fibroblast proteins which were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Phenetic analysis of both data sets supports the following conclusions: the orang utan subspecies distances are approximately 10 times closer to each other than they are to the African apes, and the orang utan subspecies are approximately as divergent as are the two chimpanzee species. Comparison of the genetic distances to genetic distance estimates done in the same laboratory under identical conditions reveals that the distance between Bornean vs. Sumatran orang utans is 5-10 times the distance measured between several pairs of subspecies including lions, cheetahs, and tigers. Near species level molecular genetic distances between orang utan subspecies would support the separate management of Bornean and Sumatran orang utans as evolutionary significant units (Ryder 1987). Evolutionary topologies were constructed from the distance data using both cladistic and phenetic methods. The majority of resulting trees affirmed previous molecular evolutionary studies that indicated that man and chimpanzee diverged from a common ancestor subsequent to the divergence of gorilla from the common ancestor.}},

Both were distinctly decreased by 6–8 years of age and thereafter the decline was far more gradual. Body weight also increased up to 6 years of age for females and 8 years for males, thereafter stabilizing for both sexes.

The authors of this chapter collated orangutan density estimates from 110 locations throughout their range, standardized these for differences in survey design and categorized each location using broad descriptions of the habitats present and the degree of logging disturbance. They found that orangutan density is higher in Sumatra than Borneo, as expected, but found no difference in density between subspecies in Borneo, which suggests that Pongo pygmaeus morio has evolved adaptations to cope with food scarcity in eastern Borneo. The authors of this chapter found support for the hypothesis that orangutan densities are higher in sites with less extreme periods of food shortage, by demonstrating that sites with a mosaic of different habitat types support significantly higher densities than those with only a single habitat type present. Orangutan density declines significantly with altitude in Borneo but the authors of this chapter did not find this relationship for Sumatra, although this may be due to other underlying factors. Heavy logging disturbance has a severe negative effect on density but light logging carried out by well-managed selective logging operations appears to have no effect on orangutan density. The chapter discusses the implications of these findings for orangutan conservation.}},

Chimpanzees, in contrast, continue to display cycles of menstrual bleeding and genital swelling, suggestive of ovulation, until near their maximum life span of about 60 years. Because ovulation was not confirmed hormonally, however, the age at which chimpanzees experience menopause has remained uncertain. In the present study, we provide hormonal data from urine samples collected from 30 female chimpanzees, of which 9 were old (>30 years), including 2 above the age of 50 years. Eight old chimpanzees showed clear endocrine evidence of ovulation, as well as cycles of genital swelling that correlated closely with measured endocrine changes. Endocrine evidence thus confirms prior observations (cyclic anogenital swelling) that menopause is a late-life event in the chimpanzee. We also unexpectedly discovered an idiopathic anovulation in some young and middle-aged chimpanzees; this merits further study. Because our results on old chimpanzees validate the use of anogenital swelling as a surrogate index of ovulation, we were able to combine data on swelling and urinary hormones to provide the first estimates of age-specific rates of menopause in chimpanzees. We conclude that menopause occurs near 50 years of age in chimpanzees as it does in women. Our finding identifies a basic difference between the human and chimpanzee aging processes: female chimpanzees can remain reproductively viable for a greater proportion of their life span than women. Thus, while menopause marks the end of the chimpanzee’s life span, women may thrive for decades more.}},

editora = {Dr. Brigitte Spillmann,Dr. Maria A. van Noordwijk,Prof. Dr. Carel P. van Schaik}, 
abstract = {{Intra-sexual competition occurs over factors that limit an individual’s reproductive fitness. Primate male’s maximum reproductive output is limited by access to fertile females, and the intensity and outcome of male-male competition can vary depending on aspects of female social organization, reproductive synchrony and monopolization potential. Orangutan females are semi-solitary, have non-advertised ovulation and long inter-birth intervals. These factors suggest intense male-male competition over infrequent fertilization opportunities. Geographic variation seen in orangutans implies that populations operate under different mating systems that may be island based. In Sumatra, there seems to be a higher potential for female monopolization, which leads to a clear ‘locally dominant male’ and stable dominance hierarchies. Whereas in Borneo a ‘promiscuous roving male’ mating system has been described with more instable dominance hierarchies. A previous study of flanged male orangutan competition in Tuanan, Borneo through the long call mechanism found a ‘confrontational assessment’ model of male-male competition. Tuanan male ranging was found to be dictated by fruit availability, with long call and response behaviour being adjusted based on presence of fertile females and other males. This study replicates the novel Acoustic Localization System (ALS) method of passive acoustic data collection used in that study in Suaq, Sumatra. A total of 184 days of complete ALS coverage were analyzed for this analysis totaling 2,196 long calls between the two sites. We tested if flanged males compete the same under these different mating systems, by analyzing male presence, daily long call rates, and long call response behaviour. Suaq male ranging behaviour does not appear to be influenced by fruit availability levels and overall there are less males passing through the study site on a yearly and daily basis. There are less daily long calls occurring within the Suaq study area and Suaq males don’t display the same distinct pre-dawn calling peak found in Tuanan males. Long calls are less likely to be responded to in Suaq compared to Tuanan, with a more delayed response latency. Suaq males with heighted spontaneous calling rates do not have heightened long call response rates, which is seen in Tuanan. These results suggest that the ‘confrontational assessment’ approach of male-male competition found in Tuanan is not found in Suaq, and Suaq flanged males compete through ‘systematic exclusion’. Frequent confrontations are not recorded or necessary in Suaq due to more stable dominance hierarchies and less unfamiliar, roving males. This thesis provides evidence for innate geographic variation in flanged male orangutan competition behaviour that goes beyond immediate forest productivity.}},

Here, we studied risk preferences of chimpanzees (86 Pan troglodytes; 47 females; age = 2–40 years) using a multimethod approach that combined observer ratings with behavioral choice experiments. We found that chimpanzees’ willingness to take risks shared structural similarities with that of humans. First, chimpanzees’ risk preference manifested as a traitlike preference that was consistent across domains and measurements. Second, chimpanzees were ambiguity averse. Third, males were more risk prone than females. Fourth, the appetite for risk showed an inverted-U-shaped relation to age and peaked in young adulthood. Our findings suggest that key dimensions of risk preference appear to emerge independently of the influence of human cultural evolution.}},

Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies revealed that intramuscular endomysial collagen (young: 9.6 ± 1.1, old: 10.2 ± 1.2 μg/mg muscle wet wt) and collagen cross-linking (hydroxylysylpyridinoline) (young: 395 ± 65, old: 351 ± 45 mmol hydroxylysylpyridinoline/mol collagen) were unchanged (P > 0.05) with aging.

While myofibrillar protein concentration was lower (−5\%, P < 0.05), the concentration of the main contractile proteins myosin and actin were unchanged (P > 0.05) with aging. These data suggest that the synthesis and degradation of proteins responsible for the generation (myosin and actin) and transfer (collagen and pyridinoline cross-links) of muscle force are tightly regulated in aging muscle.

Both morphs have recently been shown to have roughly similar levels of reproductive success in the one site where such a study has been conducted. This is in stark contrast to the unimale polygynous gorilla, in which dominant males sire almost all infants. Despite this, evidence on sexual dimorphism, life history, diet, and socioecology of extant and extinct apes, as well as the ontogeny, reproductive morphology, and physiology of extant apes, all indicate that the orang-utan's present-day mating system most likely evolved from a gorilla-like base, with one dominant male guarding a harem of females. The available evidence indicates that, due chiefly to the likely onset of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (generally regarded as the trigger for mast fruiting in dipterocarps) approximately 3–5Ma, southeast Asian forests would have begun to experience longer and more severe periods of low food availability. This change in food availability would have meant that full-time gregariousness was no longer energetically tolerable and, as a result, females dispersed more widely in search of food and adult/flanged males were no longer able to effectively guard a harem of females. A niche for a quiet, quick, opportunistic “sexual predator” (i.e., the unflanged male) then became available. This finding implies that, despite being anatomically quite chimpanzee-like, the ancestral hominoid probably had a social and mating system more similar to the gorilla than any other living ape.}},

Although our understanding of geographic variation in habitat‐wide timing and frequency of flowering and fruiting is advancing, corresponding information for individual tree species is limited. Thus, we compared climate and reproductive phenology of 16 tree species over 70 mo at two Bornean tropical peat‐swamp forest sites. We found significant inter‐site correlations in rainfall and temperature, and only small absolute temperature differences. In both sites, most species exhibited within‐site synchrony in flowering and fruiting onset. Broad‐scale flowering and fruiting onset frequency classifications showed high congruence between sites. Significant correlations in flowering and fruiting onset timing between sites were found for only 19 and 17 percent of the species, respectively. This remained the case when applying 1‐ and 2‐month lag periods for both sites, with neither site consistently lagging behind. Significant differences in the exact frequency of new flowering and fruiting events were detected for 44 and 58 percent of species, respectively, and no significant relationships between the onset timing synchrony and exact frequency of new reproductive events were found for either flowers or fruit. We conclude that inter‐site climatic and ecological similarities do not necessarily lead to high inter‐site synchrony in either onset timing or exact frequency of tree reproductive events. Potential reasons for this are discussed, as are the implications for understanding tropical forest ecology and improving forest restoration project seed collections.

We report 3 rare cases of meat-eating of slow lorises, Nycticebus coucang, by 1 Sumatran orangutan mother–infant dyad in Ketambe, Indonesia, to examine how orangutans find slow lorises and share meat. We combine these 3 cases with 2 previous ones to test the hypothesis that slow loris captures by orangutans are seasonal and dependent on fruit availability. We also provide the first (to our knowledge) quantitative data and high-definition video recordings of meat chewing rates by great apes, which we use to estimate the minimum time necessary for a female Australopithecus africanus to reach its daily energy requirements when feeding partially on raw meat. Captures seemed to be opportunistic but orangutans may have used olfactory cues to detect the prey. The mother often rejected meat sharing requests and only the infant initiated meat sharing. Slow loris captures occurred only during low ripe fruit availability, suggesting that meat may represent a filler fallback food for orangutans. Orangutans ate meat more than twice as slowly as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), suggesting that group living may function as a meat intake accelerator in hominoids. Using orangutan data as a model, time spent chewing per day would not require an excessive amount of time for our social ancestors (australopithecines and hominids), as long as meat represented no more than a quarter of their diet.}},

Testicular volume and weight were related by a constant density of 1.038 g/ml, regardless of testicular size, age or illness. Mean testicular volume was correlated with height (r = 0.470), weight (r = 0.504), body surface area (r = 0.549) and standardized body weight (r = 0.152). Advancing age, malnutrition, alcoholism, malignancy, and a chronic, terminal illness were each individual risk factors for reduced testicular size, whereas diabetes, narcotic or other drug usage, and pelvic injury were not associated with reduced testicular volume. Since advancing age, reduced standardized body weight, and some disease states were all associated with diminution of testicular size, the interaction of age, malnutrition, and illness on testicular size were examined by statistical modeling, using multivariate logistic regression and covariance analysis. The associations of alcoholism, malignancy, and chronic, terminal illness with decreased testicular volume were independent of aging or nutritional state. The effects of chronic, terminal illness were mostly explained by the concurrent effects of reductions in standardized body weight (malnutrition). After exclusion of men with diseases shown to be associated with decreased testicular size, the specific effects of age alone demonstrated a reduction in testicular volume only in the 8th decade of life. Among men aged 18–70 years dying suddenly without associated disease shown to influence testicular size, mean testicular volume was 18.1 ± 0.2 ml (95\% confidence limits 7.9–28.3) and mean testicular weight was 18.8 ± 0.2 g (95\% confidence limits 8.2–29.4). It is concluded that age, malnutrition, and illness exert independent effects on testicular function, and that the effects of age and malnutrition should be considered as important confounders of disease effects on testicular size.}},

While male primates display tremendous variation in secondary sexual traits, such as sexual skin, capes of hair, and beards, which are often attributed to sexual selection, their phylogenetic distribution remains to be fully understood. Here we investigate the hypothesis that sexual dimorphism in ornaments is more pronounced in larger more ‘anonymous’ social organizations where quick reliable assessment of male quality, social status, dominance, and aggressiveness are selective pressures. Multiple regression analyses, including phylogenetic correction, were performed on 154 species representing 45 genera of simian primates. We found a positive relationship between degree of ornamental dimorphism and group size, even after controlling for other independent variables such as habitat type (i.e. openness of terrain) and fission–fusion dynamics. Dimorphism was also significantly associated with social organization, so that males from species with multilevel social organizations had the highest ratings for ornamentation. In sum, our analysis suggests that among primates with larger group sizes and multilevel social organizations, males have more developed visually conspicuous secondary sexual traits. This may reflect selection for amplified signals of individual identity, rank, dominance, or attractiveness in large and complex social organizations wherein social and physical conflict may arise frequently and individual recognition is limited.}},

Here we use phylogenetic comparative methods and data from primates including humans, fossil hominins, and a wide sample of fossil primates including Miocene apes from Africa, Europe, and Asia to test alternative hypotheses of body mass evolution. Our results suggest, contrary to previous suggestions, that the LCA of all hominoids lived in an environment that favored a gibbon-like size, but a series of selective regime shifts, possibly due to resource availability, led to a decrease and then increase in body mass in early hominins from a chimpanzee-sized LCA. The pattern of body size evolution in hominids can provide insight into historical human ecology.

Here, we develop the hypothesis that selective social behavior is an adaptive strategy that allows social animals to balance the costs and benefits of navigating social environments in the face of age-related functional declines. We first aim to distinguish social selectivity from the non-adaptive social consequences of aging. We then outline multiple mechanisms by which social selectivity in old age may enhance fitness and healthspan. Our goal is to lay out a research agenda to identify selective strategies and their potential benefits. Given the importance of social support for health across primates, understanding why aging individuals lose social connections and how they can remain resilient has vital applications to public health research.}},

The old female rhesus monkeys exhibited a higher cortisol and corticosterone response, but a lower DHEAS response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) administration then the young monkeys. The aged rhesus monkeys also exhibited a decrease of the adrenal cortex resiliency, that was manifested in the deceleration of the decrease of cortisol concentrations after the peak values had been reached in response to ACTH 1–39 administration. At the same time the ACTH 1–24 depot test revealed no age-related changes in the maximum capacity of monkey adrenals to synthesize and secrete cortisol. The aged monkeys also developed less sensitivity of the HPA axis to dexametasone suppression test.

Little is known however about the constraints of this behaviour, e.g. the associated energetic costs. We investigated these costs in long-tailed macaques where alpha males mate guard females to a lesser extent than predicted by the priority of access model. The study was carried out during two mating periods on three wild groups living in the Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia. We combined behavioural observations on males’ locomotion and feeding activity, GPS records of distance travelled and non-invasive measurements of urinary C-peptide (UCP), a physiological indicator of male energetic status. Mate-guarding led to a decrease in feeding time and fruit consumption suggesting a reduced intake of energy. At the same time, vertical locomotion was reduced, which potentially saved energy. These findings, together with the fact that we did not find an effect of mate-guarding on UCP levels, suggest that energy intake and expenditure was balanced during mate-guarding in our study males. Mate-guarding thus seems to not be energetically costly under all circumstances. Given that in strictly seasonal rhesus macaques, high-ranking males lose physical condition over the mating period, we hypothesise that the energetic costs of mate-guarding vary inter-specifically depending on the degree of seasonality and that males of non-strictly seasonal species might be better adapted to maintain balanced energetic condition year-round. Finally, our results illustrate the importance of combining behavioural assessments of both energy intake and expenditure with physiological measures when investigating energetic costs of behavioural strategies.}},

Here we analyze the rich, pan-tropical database of classified Landsat scenes created by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations to examine pathways of agricultural expansion across the major tropical forest regions in the 1980s and 1990s and use this information to highlight the future land conversions that probably will be needed to meet mounting demand for agricultural products. Across the tropics, we find that between 1980 and 2000 more than 55\% of new agricultural land came at the expense of intact forests, and another 28\% came from disturbed forests.

Northern Sumatra comprises an area of 65 000 km2 that is both the site of Indonesia's first planned RED initiative, and the stronghold of 92\% of remaining Sumatran orangutans. Under current plans, this RED initiative will be implemented in a defined geographic area, essentially a newly established, 7500 km2 protected area (PA) comprising mostly upland forest, where guards will be recruited to enforce forest protection. Meanwhile, new roads are currently under construction, while companies are converting lowland forests into oil palm plantations. This case study predicts the effectiveness of RED in reducing deforestation and conserving orangutans for two distinct scenarios: the current plan of implementing RED within the specific boundary of a new upland PA, and an alternative scenario of implementing RED across landscapes outside PAs. Our satellite-based spatially explicit deforestation model predicts that 1313 km2 of forest would be saved from deforestation by 2030, while forest cover present in 2006 would shrink by 22\% (7913 km2) across landscapes outside PAs if RED were only to be implemented in the upland PA. Meanwhile, orangutan habitat would reduce by 16\% (1137 km2), resulting in the conservative loss of 1384 orangutans, or 25\% of the current total population with or without RED intervention. By contrast, an estimated 7824 km2 of forest could be saved from deforestation, with maximum benefit for orangutan conservation, if RED were to be implemented across all remaining forest landscapes outside PAs. Here, RED payments would compensate land users for their opportunity costs in not converting unprotected forests into oil palm, while the construction of new roads to service the marketing of oil palm would be halted. Our predictions suggest that Indonesia's first RED initiative in an upland PA may not significantly reduce deforestation in northern Sumatra and would have little impact on orangutan conservation because a large amount of forest inside the project area is protected de facto by being inaccessible, while lowland forests will remain exposed to the combined expansion of high-revenue plantations and road networks. In contrast, RED would be more effective in terms of its conservation impact if payments were extended to all remaining carbon-rich tropical forests, including lowland peat swamp forests, the preferred habitat for dense populations of orangutans, and if the construction of new roads was halted.}},

There is no island-wide documentation of forest clearance or logging since the 1970s. This creates an information gap for conservation planning, especially with regard to selectively logged forests that maintain high conservation potential. Analysing LANDSAT images, we estimate that 75.7\% (558,060 km2) of Borneo's area (737,188 km2) was forested around 1973. Based upon a forest cover map for 2010 derived using ALOS-PALSAR and visually reviewing LANDSAT images, we estimate that the 1973 forest area had declined by 168,493 km2 (30.2\%) in 2010. The highest losses were recorded in Sabah and Kalimantan with 39.5\% and 30.7\% of their total forest area in 1973 becoming non-forest in 2010, and the lowest in Brunei and Sarawak (8.4\%, and 23.1\%). We estimate that the combined area planted in industrial oil palm and timber plantations in 2010 was 75,480 km2, representing 10\% of Borneo. We mapped 271,819 km of primary logging roads that were created between 1973 and 2010. The greatest density of logging roads was found in Sarawak, at 0.89 km km−2, and the lowest density in Brunei, at 0.18 km km−2. Analyzing MODIS-based tree cover maps, we estimate that logging operated within 700 m of primary logging roads. Using this distance, we estimate that 266,257 km2 of 1973 forest cover has been logged. With 389,566 km2 (52.8\%) of the island remaining forested, of which 209,649 km2 remains intact. There is still hope for biodiversity conservation in Borneo.

Adult male sociality centered around females. Almost the entirety (90\%) of adult male participation in social groupings consisted of consortships. If time spent with recent consort partners is included, then adult males spent 95 \% of the time that they were in social groups with consorts. Otherwise adult males were quite asocial. Adult males were totally intolerant of each other. Only two brief encounters between lone adult males occurred although avoidance of contact was seen 14 times. Another two encounters between adult males in the presence of females involved much aggression and included a lengthy combat in which the male consort defeated another adult male. Thirty copulations involving adult males were seen; only one copulation was a resisted mating. The other copulations all occurred in consortship. Ten consortships were seen; three involving adult females. While subadult male reproductive tactics predominantly consist of sneak/’rape’, adult male sexual strategy consists primarily of consort/combat tactics.

For this reason, wild adult males are relatively selective in choice of consort partner and may reject small proceptive adolescent females.}},

We characterized linear body size growth in wild mountain gorillas from Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda, a population distinguished by its extreme folivory and accelerated life histories. In 131 individuals (0.09–35.26 years), we used non‐invasive parallel laser photogrammetry to measure body length, back width, arm length and two head dimensions. Nonparametric LOESS regression was used to characterize cross‐sectional distance and velocity growth curves for males and females, and consider links with key life history milestones. Sex differences became evident between 8.5 and 10.0 years of age. Thereafter, female growth velocities declined, while males showed increased growth velocities until 10.0–14.5 years across dimensions. Body dimensions varied in growth; females and males reached 98\% of maximum body length at 11.7 and 13.1 years, respectively. Females attained 95.3\% of maximum body length by mean age at first birth. Neonates were 31\% of maternal size, and doubled in size by mean weaning age. Males reached maximum body and arm length and back width before emigration, but experienced continued growth in head dimensions. While comparable data are scarce, our findings provide preliminary support for the prediction that mountain gorillas reach maximum body size at earlier ages compared to more frugivorous western gorillas. Data from other wild populations are needed to better understand comparative great ape development, and investigate links between trajectories of physical, behavioral, and reproductive maturation.}},

Socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) argues that people increasingly prioritize emotionally meaningful goals when they perceive future time as more limited. Terror management theory (TMT) suggests that mortality salience (i.e., the awareness of one’s mortality) drives people to prioritize the goal of perpetuating own existence through affirming cultural worldview. Method In this study, participants (N = 438) were randomly assigned to six conditions that primed (a) limited future time, (b) mortality salience, (c) death reflection, (d) both limited future time and mortality salience, (e) both limited future time, and death reflection, or (f) none. Results Results showed that older adults allocated significantly more resources to emotionally close recipients who supported their cultural worldviews in conditions involving future time limitation and death reflection. They also allocated less resources to emotionally not close recipients who did not support their cultural worldviews in conditions involving future time limitation. Younger adults did not show these differences. Nor did mortality salience have any effect.

The ecological factors that contribute to these differences require investigation. Significant interpopulational differences in diet suggest that ecological factors contribute to variation in tool‐based insect foraging. Using 4 years of behavioral data from the Suaq Balimbing Research Station (Sumatra, Indonesia), we tested predictions of two ecological hypotheses for the invention of tool use for insect foraging. We found limited evidence for inter‐ and intrasexual differences, as well as temporal variation, in activity budget and diet. However, differences did not correspond to variation in either rate of tool use or specialization on tool‐based insectivory. Compared to other populations, orangutans at Suaq Balimbing ate significantly more insects. Low temporal variation in insectivory and an abundance of social insects at Suaq Balimbing suggest that insects formed a staple in the diet rather than a fallback food. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that tool use is a response to the low availability of primary food sources. Rather, greater opportunities for invention likely contributed to insect‐extraction tool use at Suaq Balimbing. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.}},

Manifold advantages would attend the use of smaller, more rapidly developing, shorter-lived NHP species in aging studies, not the least of which are lower cost and the ability to do shorter research projects. Arbitrarily defining “small” primates as those weighing less than 500 g, we assess small, relatively short-lived species among the prosimians and callitrichids for suitability as models for human aging research. Using the criteria of availability, knowledge about (and ease of) maintenance, the possibility of genetic manipulation (a hallmark of 21 st century biology), and similarities to humans in the physiology of age-related changes, we suggest three species—two prosimians ( Microcebus murinus and Galago senegalensis ) and one New World monkey ( Callithrix jacchus )—that deserve scrutiny for development as major NHP models for aging studies. We discuss one other New World monkey group, Cebus spp., that might also be an effective NHP model of aging as these species are longer-lived for their body size than any primate except humans.}},

However, it is also likely that female preferences for certain male faces arise from the fact that dominant‐ and masculine‐looking males are signaling characteristics which may be beneficial in intrasexual conflict, and thereby also indicate potential achievers of high status, an important factor in female mate selection. Although numerous studies were built on this assumption, nothing is known about the relationship between perceived facial dominance and physical strength in men. We measured hand‐grip strength, as a measure of overall physical strength, in a sample of 32 male students, and recorded age, body weight, and height. Seventy‐nine women rated facial images of these men for dominance, masculinity, and attractiveness. After controlling for age and body weight, hand‐grip strength was found to correlate significantly positively with all three measures. The present data thus support the supposition that a male's physical strength is also signaled via facial characteristics of dominance and masculinity, which are considered attractive by women. Am.

The length of the vocal folds determines the minimum fundamental frequency, while the size and the shape of the vocal tract affect its filtering characteristics and hence, the resonant frequencies. Both measures—vocal fold length and vocal tract length—are related to body size and therefore, acoustic features are expected to vary with body size. Because direct measures of body size are difficult to obtain from free-ranging animals, age and sex have often been used as proxies. We surveyed studies which included direct measures of size or weight, and also studies in which only age and/or sex differences were examined. The main purpose was to examine whether age- and sex-related variations in acoustic features meet the predictions generated from our knowledge about sound production. Our survey revealed that compared to smaller animals, larger animals utter longer calls, with a lower fundamental frequency, with smaller formant dispersion, and with the energy concentrated in lower frequencies. Age and sex reliably reflect the influence of body size on acoustic features when gross size differences are examined. However, within age- and sex classes, this relationship may break down. In addition to body size, other factors such as internal state or social context may also influence the structure of vocal signals and highlight the richness of information in calls that is potentially available to listeners.}},

During fires, particulate matter (PM10) concentrations were hazardous. Orangutans increased rest time during and after the smoke period, and decreased travel time and distance and increased fat catabolism post-smoke. The increase in post-smoke ketones was not related to changes in caloric intake and was likely due to an increase in energy expenditure, possibly related to immune response.

We investigated how these differing life trajectories affect social interest and emerging ecological knowledge in immatures. We analyzed 15 years of detailed observational data on social learning, associations, and diet repertoires of 50 immatures (16 females and 34 males), from 2 orangutan populations. Specific to the feeding context, we found sex differences in the development of social interest: Throughout the dependency period, immature females direct most of their social attention at their mothers, whereas immature males show an increasing attentional preference for individuals other than their mothers. When attending to non-mother individuals, males show a significant bias toward immigrant individuals and a trend for a bias toward adult males. In contrast, females preferentially attend to neighboring residents. Accordingly, by the end of the dependency period, immature females show a larger dietary overlap with their mothers than do immature males. These results suggest that immature orangutans show attentional biases through which they learn from individuals with the most relevant ecological knowledge. Diversifying their skills and knowledge likely helps males when they move to a new area. In sum, our findings underline the importance of fine-grained social inputs for the acquisition of ecological knowledge and skills in orangutans and likely in other apes as well.}},

Similar to chimpanzees and bonobos, it also was predicted DHEA-S would not be significantly different between males and females. DHEA-S was assayed from serum banked during physical examinations of gorillas housed at three North American zoos (n = 63). Gorillas ranged from 6 to 52 years of age. Differences between males and females were examined using t tests. Linear regression was used to determine the relationship of DHEA-S with age. There was no significant difference in DHEA-S between males and females. Additionally, there was no significant relationship between DHEA-S and age. As predicted, there were no sex-based differences in DHEA-S in gorillas, which is similar to chimpanzees and bonobos but different from modern humans. Unlike chimpanzees and humans, there was no significant relationship between DHEA-S and age in gorillas. The absence of a relationship between age and DHEA-S may be due to the lack of gorillas under age 6 years in this sample as declines in chimpanzees occur prior to age 5 years, more rapid growth and development among gorillas compared with other African hominoids, or a unique pattern of DHEA-S production.}},

We applied an allostatic load index to gorillas housed at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium (N = 27, 1956–2014) using data from medical records and biomarkers from banked serum. We estimated allostatic load using seven biomarkers (albumin, cortisol, corticotropin-releasing hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, glucose, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) and then examined this index for associations with age, sex, number of stressful events, parturition, physiological health measures, and age at death.

Determining how stressors influence health, well‐being, and longevity in human and nonhuman primate populations are major foci within biological anthropology. Although much effort has been devoted to examining responses to multiple environmental and sociocultural stressors, no holistic metric to measure stress‐related physiological dysfunction has been widely applied within biological anthropology. Researchers from disciplines outside anthropology are using allostatic load indices (ALIs) to estimate such dysregulation and examine life‐long outcomes of stressor exposures, including morbidity and mortality. Following allostasis theory, allostatic load represents accumulated physiological and somatic damage secondary to stressors and senescent processes experienced over the lifespan. ALIs estimate this wear‐and‐tear using a composite of biomarkers representing neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems. Across samples, ALIs are associated significantly with multiple individual characteristics (e.g., age, sex, education, DNA variation) of interest within biological anthropology. They also predict future outcomes, including aspects of life history variation (e.g., survival, lifespan), mental and physical health, morbidity and mortality, and likely health disparities between groups, by stressor exposures, ethnicity, occupations, and degree of departure from local indigenous life ways and integration into external and commodified ones. ALIs also may be applied to similar stress‐related research areas among nonhuman primates. Given the reports from multiple research endeavors, here we propose ALIs may be useful for assessing stressors, stress responses, and stress‐related dysfunction, current and long‐term cognitive function, health and well‐being, and risk of early mortality across many research programs within biological anthropology.}},

abstract = {{ The origin of the fundamental behavioral differences between humans and our closest living relatives is one of the central issues of evolutionary anthropology. The prominent, chimpanzee-based referential model of early hominin behavior has recently been challenged on the basis of broad multispecies comparisons and newly discovered fossil evidence. Here, we argue that while behavioral data on extant great apes are extremely relevant for reconstruction of ancestral behaviors, these behaviors should be reconstructed trait by trait using formal phylogenetic methods. Using the widely accepted hominoid phylogenetic tree, we perform a series of character optimization analyses using 65 selected life-history and behavioral characters for all extant hominid species. This analysis allows us to reconstruct the character states of the last common ancestors of Hominoidea, Hominidae, and the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor. Our analyses demonstrate that many fundamental behavioral and life-history attributes of hominids (including humans) are evidently ancient and likely inherited from the common ancestor of all hominids. However, numerous behaviors present in extant great apes represent their own terminal autapomorphies (both uniquely derived and homoplastic). Any evolutionary model that uses a single extant species to explain behavioral evolution of early hominins is therefore of limited use. In contrast, phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral states is able to provide a detailed suite of behavioral, ecological and life-history characters for each hypothetical ancestor. The living great apes therefore play an important role for the confident identification of the traits found in the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor, some of which are likely to represent behaviors of the fossil hominins.}},

abstract = {{ Developmental instability (DI) reflects the inability of a developing organism to buffer its development against random perturbations, due either to frequent, large perturbations or to a poor buffering system. The primary measure used to assess DI experienced by an individual organism is fluctuating asymmetry (FA), asymmetry of bilateral features that are, on average in a population, symmetrical. A large literature on FA in humans in relation to measures of health and quality (close to 100 studies and nearly 300 individual effect size estimates) has accumulated. This paper presents the first quantitative meta-analysis of this literature. The mean effect size (scaled as Pearson r) was about 0.2. Effect sizes covaried negatively with sample size, consistent with effects of publication bias, the tendency for significant effects to be published. Conservative correction for this bias reduced the mean effect to about 0.1. Associations with FA underestimate effects of underlying DI due to imprecise measurement of the latter. A model-based best estimate of the mean effect of DI on outcomes is about 0.3, a theoretically meaningful, relatively large effect, albeit of moderate absolute size. The data are consistent, however, with a range of true effect sizes between 0.08 and 0.67, partly due to large study effects. Study-specific effect sizes in DI ranged between −0.2 and 1.0. A humbling and perhaps sobering conclusion is that, in spite of a large body of literature involving nearly 50 000 participants, we can only confidently state that there is on average a robust positive average effect size. An accurate estimate of that effect size was not possible, and between-study variation remained largely unexplained. We detected no robust variation across six broad categories of outcomes (health and disease, fetal outcomes, psychological maladaptation, reproduction, attractiveness and hormonal effects), though examination of narrower domains reveal some corrected effects close to 0.2 and others near zero. The meta-analysis suggests fruitful directions for future research and theory.}},

abstract = {{The role of developmental instability (DI), as measured by fluctuating asymmetry (FA), in evolutionary biology has been the focus of a wealth of research for more than half a century. In spite of this long period and many published papers, our current state of knowledge reviewed here only allows us to conclude that patterns are heterogeneous and that very little is known about the underlying causes of this heterogeneity. In addition, the statistical properties of FA as a measure of DI are only poorly grasped because of a general lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive DI. If we want to avoid that this area of research becomes abandoned, more efforts should be made to understand the observed heterogeneity, and attempts should be made to develop a unifying statistical protocol. More specifically, and perhaps most importantly, it is argued here that more attention should be paid to the usefulness of FA as a measure of DI since many factors might blur this relationship. Furthermore, the genetic architecture, associations with fitness and the importance of compensatory growth should be investigated under a variety of stress situations. In addition, more focus should be directed to the underlying mechanisms of DI as well as how these processes map to the observable phenotype. These insights could yield more efficient statistical models and a unified approach to the analysis of patterns in FA and DI. The study of both DI and canalization is indispensable to obtain better insights in their possible common origin, especially because both have been suggested to play a role in both micro‐ and macro‐evolutionary processes.}},

Degree of masculinity/femininity and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) may signal (genetic) quality, but what information they harboured and how they relate to fitness is still debated. Aim: To study strength of associations between facial masculinity/femininity, facial FA, attractiveness and physical strength in humans. Subjects and methods: Two-hundred young males and females were studied by measuring facial asymmetry and masculinity on the basis of frontal photographs. Attractiveness was determined on the basis of scores given by an anonymous panel, and physical strength using hand grip strength. Results: Patterns differed markedly between males and females and analysis method used (univariate vs multivariate). Overall, no associations between FA and attractiveness, masculinity and physical strength were found. In females, but not males, masculinity and attractiveness correlated negatively and masculinity and physical strength correlated positively. Conclusion: Further research into the differences between males and females in associations between facial morphology, attractiveness and physical strength is clearly needed. The use of a multivariate approach can increase our understanding of which regions of the face harbour specific information of hormone levels and perhaps behavioural traits.}},

abstract = {{Relatively few data exist on population differences in the vocal behavior of mammals. Geographic variation in calls is of special interest because of the implications for resolving evolutionary and behavioral questions. For example, information on geographic variation in vocalizations complements morphological and molecular data used to infer phylogenetic relationships and provides evidence for the mechanisms underlying call development. A quantitative acoustic analysis of orangutan long calls was undertaken, comparing flanged adult males from four geographically distinct sites across Borneo and Sumatra, revealing consistent differences among the calls of individuals. Long calls produced by orangutans from the four sites in Borneo and Sumatra differ in quantitative acoustic measures. Discriminant function analysis reveals that acoustic variables can be used in combination to assign calls to the correct individual, site and island at rates higher than that expected by chance. Specifically, four acoustic parameters proved reliable for distinguishing among the individuals, between sites, and across the two islands that arguably represent populations from separate species or subspecies. Although Bornean and Sumatran long calls share a repetitive structure and show similar call rates (0.100–0.500 LCs/h) and maximum frequency bands (0.400–1.500 kHz), they differ significantly in the number of pulses per call, call speed, call duration, bandwidth, pulse duration, and dominant frequency. Strong consistency in these acoustic parameters is also seen among males within sites and the observed variation may allow for individual recognition. Individual identification by call structure presumably benefits dispersed orangutans, where individuals characteristically forage independently and both encounters and interactions with signaling males are highly variable and largely dependent on context. Acoustic recognition of callers facilitates the choice of which males to join or avoid, thus allowing receivers to manipulate potential costs and benefits of association.}},

This study addresses asymmetry under nutritional/systemic stress in the human craniofacial skeleton and its utility as an indicator of developmental instability. Crania from the diachronic Christian cemeteries at Kulubnarti (Sudanese Nubia) were chosen as a model for nutrition/systemic stress. Previous studies indicate that individuals from the Early Christian cemetery were subjected to greater developmental stress when compared with individuals from the Late Christian cemetery. Therefore, crania from the Early Christian cemetery should display a greater magnitude of fluctuating asymmetry than crania from the Late Christian cemetery. Thirty adult crania of comparable age and sex were selected from each population. Landmark coordinates were digitized in two separate trials and averaged to minimize error. Euclidean distance matrix analysis (EDMA) was used to measure and compare the magnitude of fluctuating asymmetry in each sample. Results indicate that crania from the Early Christian cemetery display greater amounts of fluctuating asymmetry than those from the Late Christian cemetery, as predicted. The degree of fluctuating asymmetry for each linear distance is highly correlated between the cemeteries, suggesting that all humans may share common patterns of fluctuating asymmetry in the skull. In contrast, there is little correlation between magnitude of fluctuating asymmetry and length of linear distance, between‐subject variability, or measurement error. These results support the hypothesis that poor nutrition/systemic stress increases developmental instability in the human skull and that increased fluctuating asymmetry constitutes morphological evidence of this stress.

Physiological and neurobiological differences between dominant and subordinate monkeys have been interpreted in the context of chronic social stress. The present experiments were designed to investigate the relationships between basal cortisol and testosterone concentrations and the establishment and maintenance of the social hierarchy in male cynomolgus monkeys. Cortisol concentrations were measured at baseline and following suppression with dexamethasone (DEX) and subsequent administration of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) while monkeys were individually housed (n = 20) and after 3 months of social housing (n = 4/group), by which time dominance hierarchies had stabilised. Cortisol was also measured during the initial 3 days of social housing. Neither pre‐social housing hormone concentrations, nor hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis sensitivity predicted eventual social rank. During initial social housing, cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in monkeys that eventually became subordinate; this effect dissipated within 3 days. During the 12 weeks of social housing, aggressive and submissive behaviours were observed consistently, forming the basis for assignment of social ranks. At this time, basal testosterone and cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in dominant monkeys and, after DEX suppression, cortisol release in response to a challenge injection of ACTH was significantly greater in subordinates. These results indicate that basal cortisol and testosterone concentrations and HPA axis function are state variables that differentially reflect position in the dominance hierarchy, rather than trait variables that predict future social status.}},

Despite conflicting reports, a reliable positive relationship between male dominance rank and mating success amongst animals of the same age class is seen. Furthermore, the variation in correlation coefficient values is significantly negatively related to the number of males in the group (the single exception being highly dimorphic primate species, where instead the correlation coefficient is positively related to the number of females). The intensity of the effect of the number of males is most severe in seasonal breeders. These results indicate that the relationship between dominance rank and mating success appears to be a function of the level of competition that males face in the group for access to cycling females.

abstract = {{In most animals, females are larger than males. Paradoxically, sexual size dimorphism is biased towards males in most mammalian species. An accepted explanation is that sexual dimorphism in mammals evolved by intramale sexual selection. I tested this hypothesis in primates, by relating sexual size dimorphism to seven proxies of sexual selection intensity: operational sex ratio, mating system, intermale competition, group sex ratio, group size, maximum mating percentage (percentage of observed copulations involving the most successful male), and total paternity (a genetic estimate of the percentage of young sired by the most successful male). I fitted phylogenetic generalised least squares models using sexual size dimorphism as the dependent variable and each of the seven measures of intensity of sexual selection as independent variables. I conducted this comparative analysis with data from 50 extant species of primates, including Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla spp. Sexual dimorphism was positively related to the four measures of female monopolisation (operational sex ratio, mating system, intermale competition, and group sex ratio) and in some cases to group size, but was not associated with maximum mating percentage or total paternity. Additional regression analyses indicated that maximum mating percentage and total paternity were negatively associated with group size. These results are predicted by reproductive skew theory: in large groups, males can lose control of the sexual behaviour of the other members of the group or can concede reproductive opportunities to others. The results are also consistent with the evolution of sexual size dimorphism before polygyny, due to the effects of natural, rather than sexual, selection. In birds, the study of molecular paternity showed that variance in male reproductive success is much higher than expected by behaviour. In mammals, recent studies have begun to show the opposite trend, i.e. that intensity of sexual selection is lower than expected by polygyny. Results of this comparative analysis of sexual size dimorphism and sexual selection intensity in primates suggest that the use of intramale sexual selection theory to explain the evolution of polygyny and sexual dimorphism in mammals should be reviewed, and that natural selection should be considered alongside sexual selection as an evolutionary driver of sexual size dimorphism and polygyny in mammals. In most animals, females are larger than males, but in most mammals, males are larger than females. This sexual dimorphism is believed to have evolved via sexual selection: males compete to mate with females, and bigger males are more likely to win. Analysis of sexual dimorphism in extant species of primate (including humans, chimpanzees and gorillas) in relation to proxies of sexual selection intensity (operational sex ratio, mating system, intermale competition, group sex ratio, group size, percentage of matings by the dominant male, and percentage of paternity by the dominant male) suggests that, alongside sexual selection, natural selection may be an evolutionary driver of sexual size dimorphism and polygyny. Sexual dimorphism may have evolved before polygyny, for example via niche partitioning between the sexes, which may occur when the sexes compete for resources such as food. Males and females may have evolved to differ in size so that they could exploit different resources. This photo shows a family of black howler monkeys Alouatta caraya in an Argentinean forest. This species is sexually dimorphic, with males larger than females, and it is also sexually dichromatic, with black males and brown females.}},

abstract = {{Primates are facing an impending extinction crisis, driven by extensive habitat loss, land use change and hunting. Climate change is an additional threat, which alone or in combination with other drivers, may severely impact those taxa unable to track suitable environmental conditions. Here, we investigate the extent of climate and land use/cover (LUC) change‐related risks for primates. We employed an analytical approach to objectively select a subset of climate scenarios, for which we then calculated changes in climatic and LUC conditions for 2050 across primate ranges (N = 426 species) under a best‐case scenario and a worst‐case scenario. Generalized linear models were used to examine whether these changes varied according to region, conservation status, range extent and dominant habitat. Finally, we reclassified primate ranges based on different magnitudes of maximum temperature change, and quantified the proportion of ranges overall and of primate hotspots in particular that are likely to be exposed to extreme temperature increases. We found that, under the worst‐case scenario, 74\% of Neotropical forest‐dwelling primates are likely to be exposed to maximum temperature increases up to 7°C. In contrast, 38\% of Malagasy savanna primates will experience less pronounced warming of up to 3.5°C. About one quarter of Asian and African primates will face up to 50\% crop expansion within their range. Primary land (undisturbed habitat) is expected to disappear across species' ranges, whereas secondary land (disturbed habitat) will increase by up to 98\%. With 86\% of primate ranges likely to be exposed to maximum temperature increases >3°C, primate hotspots in the Neotropics are expected to be particularly vulnerable. Our study highlights the fundamental exposure risk of a large percentage of primate ranges to predicted climate and LUC changes. Importantly, our findings underscore the urgency with which climate change mitigation measures need to be implemented to avert primate extinctions on an unprecedented scale. For all 426 primate species available in the IUCN database, we assessed species' exposure risk to projected changes in climatic and land use/cover conditions for the year 2050 under a best‐ and a worst‐case scenario. Our analyses revealed that Malagasy primates will be the least affected by climate change, whereas effects will be most pervasive in the Neotropics, likely exposing especially forest‐dwelling primates to highly elevated temperatures across their ranges. Across most species' ranges, undisturbed habitat is expected to be replaced by disturbed habitat, and pervasive crop expansion is forecast particularly across the ranges of Asian and African primates.}},

The inextricable association between time left in life and chronological age ensures age-related differences in social goals. Nonetheless, the authors show that the perception of time is malleable, and social goals change in both younger and older people when time constraints are imposed.

Recently, the topic has been revived and modern phylogenetic methods have been applied to large data sets, allowing researchers to assess, for the first time, the relative importance of three classic hypotheses for the function of coloration in mammals: concealment, communication, and regulation of physiological processes. Camouflage appears to be the single most important evolutionary force in explaining overall coloration in mammals, whereas patches of colored fur are used for intraspecific signaling. Sexual selection is associated with flamboyant ornamentation in a minority of primates and other restricted mammalian taxa, but to a far lesser extent than in birds. Interspecific signaling among mammals includes aposematic coloration, exaggeration of signals to deter pursuit, and lures for misdirecting predatory attack. Physiological causes of coloration, including melanism, are evident but poorly researched. The relative importance of evolutionary forces responsible for external coloration varies greatly between vertebrate taxa, but the reasons for this variation are not yet understood.}},

Our objectives were to validate our method and apparatus, discuss issues encountered, and construct preliminary growth curves. For adult males, we also compared flange width to forearm length as a way to investigate the relationship between body size and flange development. We used a camera cage around a DSLR camera, on top of which we attached two parallel green lasers. We estimated error with repeatability, accuracy, and interobserver reliability measures, and measured forearm lengths in three different ways to see which was most consistent. The longest forearm measure was the most repeatable (CV = 1.64\%), and was similar to flange repeatability (3.50\%). Accuracy measurements of a known object were high (error = 0.25\%), and Interobserver discrepancy low (3.74\%). Laser spacing increased with distance to the subject, but we corrected for this using calibration photos after each session. We transparently discuss the issues we encountered with the aim that this accessible method can help expand the use of laser photogrammetry. Preliminary measurements show that male flange widths and forearm length do not reliably increase in tandem, and that female growth plateaus at around the age at first birth (15 years old). We conclude with suggested improvements to the apparatus and method to ensure the lasers remain parallel. We constructed and field‐tested a new parallel laser apparatus made from commercially available parts, and used it to take remote measurement of wild Bornean orangutans. This apparatus is cheaper than those specialty‐made in machine shops, and requires no expertise to assemble. This marks an important step forward in making laser photogrammetry studies more accessible, and provides preliminary data on Bornean orangutan growth and the relationship between a prominent secondary sexual characteristic and body size in flanged males. We developed a parallel laser photogrammetry apparatus made from commercially available parts and requiring no mechanical expertise to assemble, making it more affordable and accessible to other scientists. We tested this apparatus with wild Bornean orangutans in primary forest, representing some of the most difficult photogrammetry conditions, and measured forearm lengths and flange widths (for males) of 16 individuals across a range of age classes.

Such individuals may thus display higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA)—small, random departures from perfect bilateral symmetry. These small deviations from symmetry are often less than 1 \% of trait size, similar to variation in symmetry generated by measurement error. Studies regarding FA must thoroughly assess measurement error if reliable conclusions regarding FA and fitness parameters are to be drawn. Although many studies regarding facial symmetry in humans have been conducted, few have been carried out on non-human primates. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether facial FA in a non-human primate, the olive baboon (Papio anubis) can be reliably measured from digital photographs. Facial FA was measured in three sets of bilaterally symmetrical landmarks from digital images of 35 olive baboons at Gashaka-Gumti National Park, Nigeria. Measurement error was found to be low indicating a high level of reliability based on comparisons of values from two photos of the same individual (r = 0.85). Measurement error was found to be related to the size of the face. This suggests that orientation error increases in large faces and could potentially influence FA scores. These findings highlight the need for FA studies to measure and control error caused by orientation and position of subjects if FA is to be of utility to behavioural ecology and conservation (e.g. if FA reflects whether individuals in a population are suffering from environmental or genetic stress).}},

However, the reliability of FA as a biomarker has come under question due to inconsistent results in the literature. We conducted a meta-analysis of published literature to test the hypothesis that FA is a reliable biomarker of environmental stress in insects and identify possible sources of variation amongst studies. We expected studies to detect larger, positive magnitudes of effect on FA in lab populations due to the lack of confounding effects from other environmental factors compared to wild populations. Additionally, we predicted that studies that used geometric morphometric approaches to FA in shape and size would be more sensitive to changes in environmental quality compared to linear and meristic measures and thus show larger effects on FA. We also expected anthropogenic stressors to generate significantly larger effects on FA compared to naturally occurring stressors due to the organisms’ inability to buffer developmental pathways against a novel stressor. Finally, we predicted comparatively larger magnitudes of effect in studies that verified the environmental factor acting on the organism was a stressor by detecting negative effects on fitness-related traits. Overall, we found that FA is a sensitive biomarker of environmental stress. Environmental stressors explained 36\% of the variation of effect on FA across studies. Studies that demonstrated a negative effect of the stressor on fitness-related traits showed significantly larger, positive magnitudes of effect on FA compared to studies that did not detect an effect from the environmental stressor. Additionally, studies conducted under laboratory conditions detected significantly larger, effects on FA compared to field-based studies. The kind of trait measured and the novelty of the stressor did not significantly account for differences amongst studies. Thus, the use of FA as a biomarker of environmental stress is a legitimate tool particularly when studies verify the biological relevance of stressors for the study organism.}},

Socially subordinate, ‘unflanged’ males are comparable to females in their size and facial morphology, while socially dominant ‘flanged’ males exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism and secondary sexual characteristics, primarily in the form of cheek pads (‘flanges’). Although male ornaments in other species are often phenotypically plastic, such characteristics in orang-utans are irreversible—and, given that both morphs are sexually mature and can father offspring—their adaptive significance remains unclear. We determined paternity of orang-utans at Camp Leakey in Tanjung Puting National Park, within the home range of one long-term dominant male, Kusasi, before, during and after his period of dominance, in comparison with subordinate male conspecifics. We found that Kusasi fathered substantially more offspring conceived during his dominant period than any other male and that socially subordinate, unflanged males only fathered offspring during periods of rank instability. We conclude that orang-utan male bimaturism is consistent with an evolutionarily stable reproductive strategy and that reproduction within the range of a dominant, flanged male is highly skewed in his favour, while unflanged males may largely wait for reproductive opportunities.}},

Here, we investigate the effects of an uncharacteristically long period of fruit scarcity, following widespread thick haze caused by peat and forest fires in 2015, on the behaviour and sociality of female Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii). We collected data from 2010 to 2018 at Tuanan, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and compared the activity, diet, and association patterns of adult females during low-fruit periods before the fires, i.e., regular, seasonal periods of low fruit availability (“pre-fire”), and after the fires, i.e., during the extended period of low fruit availability (“post-fire”). First, we found that, post-fire, female orangutans adopted a more extreme energy-saving activity pattern and diet — resting more, travelling less, and diet-switching to less-preferred foods — compared to pre-fire. Second, we found that the probabilities of association between females and their weaned immature offspring, and between related and unrelated adult females were lower, and the probability of agonism between unrelated females was higher, post-fire than pre-fire. This change in energetic strategy, and the general reduction in gregariousness and social tolerance, demonstrates how forest fires can have lasting consequences for orangutans. Fission–fusion species such as orangutans can mitigate the effects of changes in resource landscapes by altering their (sub)grouping patterns; however, this may have long-term indirect consequences on their fitness.}},

The relationship between testosterone and social behavior such as mating and aggression has been investigated in a variety of primate species, but few such studies have been conducted on chimpanzees, and even fewer on primates during the juvenile and adolescent periods. This study explores the relationship between baseline urinary testosterone and behavioral variables including dominance rank, rates of aggression toward peers, and behavioral style in 16 juvenile and adolescent male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) living at the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana. Behavioral observations and urine collection occurred during four research periods, each a year apart. After correcting for the positive association between testosterone and age, testosterone was positively associated with both dominance rank and rates of aggression directed at others. It was negatively associated with rates of aggression received. Individuals scoring highest in the “mellow” behavioral style component showed higher levels of testosterone than individuals scoring lowest in this component, an effect that may be partially due to the confounding effect of rank. The results of this study suggest that hormonal changes during the period preceding adulthood are not simply programmed physiological processes tied primarily to age‐related change, but that important age‐independent relationships with behavior also exist.

There is much empirical evidence of mate choice, and its evolution is clarified by mathematical models. Recent advances in theory also consider costs of choice, effects of deleterious mutations, fast and slow evolution of preferences and preferred traits, and simultaneous preferences for several traits. Contests over mates are important; so is sperm competition, scrambles, endurance rivalry, and coercion. The latter mechanisms have received less attention than mate choice.

Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) refers to the difference between the right and left sides in characters that should otherwise be bilaterally symmetrical, but whose expression is affected by epigenetic stress during development. Forest fragmentation may promote an increase in FA in isolated populations, by either genetic or environmental stress. FA may function as a biomonitor index in conservation biology if increased levels were observed in populations from fragmented habitats. 2. We tested the hypothesis that FA is higher in birds from small tropical forest patches than in large forest tracts. We measured wing and tarsus FA on mist‐netted birds from seven fragments and seven continuous areas from south‐eastern Atlantic rain forest in Brazil. We performed FA comparisons between fragments and control groups for the whole community, for individual foraging guilds and for the six most abundant species. 3. Wing and tarsus FA were significantly greater in fragments than continuous areas for the whole community and were both negatively correlated with forest fragment size. Differences in FA varied among foraging guilds, being more evident for insectivorous species, especially those feeding in or near the understorey. 4. FA levels increased significantly in forest fragments in at least one trait for five of the six most abundant species. There was no correlation between tarsus and wing asymmetries for the individuals of any species nor any difference between the degree of asymmetries of these characters. 5. We suggest that FA is a useful tool to assess the effects of fragmentation on forest birds, and may be applied in monitoring neotropical birds. FA indices might be profitably developed, particularly in species most threatened by fragmentation effects and when investigated in different morphological characters.}},

abstract = {{Human aging is accompanied by a decrease in social activity and a narrowing in social networks. Studies in nonhuman primates may provide valuable comparative insights in which way aging impacts social life, in the absence of cultural conventions and an awareness of a limited lifetime. For female Barbary macaques at “La Forêt des Singes” in Rocamadour, France, we previously reported an age‐associated decrease in active grooming time and network size. Here, we aimed to extend these findings by investigating in which way physical decline, spatial proximity, and aggression vary with age in female Barbary macaques. We analyzed >1,200 hr of focal observations for 46 females aged 5–29 years. As expected, older females engaged less frequently in challenging locomotor activity, such as climbing or running, than younger ones. The previously reported decrease in grooming time was not due to shorter grooming bout duration. Instead, active grooming bouts lasted even longer, which discounts the idea that manual fatigue explains the shift in grooming pattern. We found that older females tended to be spatially reclusive and that they were less frequently the targets of aggression. Although older females showed aggressive behaviors at similar rates as younger females, the proportion of low‐level aggression (i.e., threats) increased with age. We suggest that these threats are not simply a signal of dominance, but also function to deter approaches by others. Overall, these findings are in line with the idea that older females aim to avoid potentially negative interactions, specifically if these are costly. In sum, these findings support the idea that shifts in female Barbary macaques' grooming activity, do not simply result from physical deterioration, but are instead due to a higher selectivity in the choice of social partners. With increasing age, female Barbary macaques become socially more selective. They are less physically active, spatially more reclusive, less likely to engage in chases and physical attacks, and appear to avoid potentially negative interactions.}},

Whereas the selectivity in goals has been attributed to losses in resources (e.g., physical strength) [3], the increasing focus on emotionally meaningful partners is, according to socioemotional selectivity theory, driven by the awareness of one’s decreasing future lifetime [2]. Similar to humans, aging monkeys show physical losses [4] and reductions in social activity [2, 5–7]. To disentangle a general resource loss and the awareness of decreasing time, we combined field experiments with behavioral observations in a large age-heterogeneous population of Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) at La Forêt des Singes. Novel object tests revealed a loss of interest in the nonsocial environment in early adulthood, which was modulated by the availability of a food reward. Experiments using vocal and visual representations of social partners indicated that monkeys maintained an interest in social stimuli and a preferential interest in friends and socially important individuals into old age. Old females engaged in fewer social interactions, although other group members continued to invest in relationships with them. Consequently, reductions in sociality were not due to a decrease in social interest. In conclusion, some of the motivational shifts observed in aging humans, particularly the increasing focus on social over nonsocial stimuli, may occur in the absence of a limited time perspective and are most likely deeply rooted in primate evolution. Our findings highlight the value of nonhuman primates as valuable models for understanding human aging [8, 9].}},
